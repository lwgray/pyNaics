Sector 11--Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and HuntingT 

 

The Sector as a Whole 

Crop ProductionT 

 
   The Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in growing 
crops, raising animals, harvesting timber, and harvesting fish and other animals from a farm, ranch, or their natural 
habitats. 
   The establishments in this sector are often described as farms, ranches, dairies, greenhouses, nurseries, orchards, 
or hatcheries.  A farm may consist of a single tract of land or a number of separate tracts which may be held under 
different tenures.  For example, one tract may be owned by the farm operator and another rented.  It may be operated 
by the operator alone or with the assistance of members of the household or hired employees, or it may be operated 
by a partnership, corporation, or other type of organization. When a landowner has one or more tenants, renters, 
croppers, or managers, the land operated by each is considered a farm. 
   The sector distinguishes two basic activities: agricultural production and agricultural support activities.  
Agricultural production includes establishments performing the complete farm or ranch operation, such as farm 
owner-operators, tenant farm operators, and sharecroppers.  Agricultural support activities include establishments 
that perform one or more activities associated with farm operation, such as soil preparation, planting, harvesting, and 
management, on a contract or fee basis. 
   Excluded from the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector are establishments primarily engaged in 
agricultural research and establishments primarily engaged in administering programs for regulating and conserving 
land, mineral, wildlife, and forest use.  These establishments are classified in Industry 54171, Research and 
Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences; and Industry 92412, Administration of Conservation 
Programs, respectively.

   Industries in the Crop Production subsector grow crops mainly for food and fiber.  The subsector comprises 
establishments, such as farms, orchards, groves, greenhouses, and nurseries, primarily engaged in growing crops, 
plants, vines, or trees and their seeds. 
   The industries in this subsector are grouped by similarity of production activity, including biological and 
physiological characteristics and economic requirements, the length of growing season, degree of crop rotation, 
extent of input specialization, labor requirements, and capital demands.  The production process is typically 
completed when the raw product or commodity grown reaches the "farm gate" for market, that is, at the point of first 
sale or price determination.  
   Establishments are classified to the Crop Production subsector when crop production (i.e., value of crops for 
market) accounts for one-half or more of the establishment's total agricultural production.  Within the subsector, 
establishments are classified to a specific industry when a product or industry family of products (i.e., oilseed and 
grain farming, vegetable and melon farming, fruit and tree nut farming) account for one-half or more of the 
establishment's agricultural production.  Establishments with one-half or more crop production with no one product 
or family of products of an industry accounting for one-half of the establishment's agricultural production are treated 
as general combination crop farming and are classified in Industry 11199, All Other Crop Farming.  
   Industries in the Crop Production subsector include establishments that own, operate, and manage and those that 
operate and manage.  Those that manage only are classified in Subsector 115, Support Activities for Agriculture and 
Forestry.  Establishments that raise aquatic plants in controlled or selected aquatic environments are classified in 
Subsector 112, Animal Production and Aquaculture.

Animal Production and AquacultureT 

 
112 
 
   Industries in the Animal Production and Aquaculture subsector raise or fatten animals for the sale of animals or 
animal products and/or raise aquatic plants and animals in controlled or selected aquatic environments for the sale of 
aquatic plants, animals, or their products.  The subsector includes establishments, such as ranches, farms, and 
feedlots primarily engaged in keeping, grazing, breeding, or feeding animals.  These animals are kept for the 
products they produce or for eventual sale.  The animals are generally raised in various environments, from total 
confinement or captivity to feeding on an open range pasture.   
   The industries in this subsector are grouped by important factors, such as suitable grazing or pasture land, 
specialized buildings, type of equipment, and the amount and types of labor required.  Establishments are classified 
to the Animal Production and Aquaculture subsector when animal production (i.e., value of animals for market) 
accounts for one-half or more of the establishment's total agricultural production.  Establishments with one-half or 
more animal production with no one animal product or family of animal products of an industry accounting for one-
half of the establishment's agricultural production are treated as combination animal farming classified to Industry

Forestry and LoggingT 

 
113 
 
   Industries in the Forestry and Logging subsector grow and harvest timber on a long production cycle (i.e., of 10 
years or more).  Long production cycles use different production processes than short production cycles, which 
require more horticultural interventions prior to harvest, resulting in processes more similar to those found in the 
Crop Production subsector.  Consequently, Christmas tree production and other production involving production 
cycles of less than 10 years, are classified in the Crop Production subsector.  
   Industries in this subsector specialize in different stages of the production cycle.  Reforestation requires production 
of seedlings in specialized nurseries.  Timber production requires natural forest or suitable areas of land that are 
available for a long duration.  The maturation time for timber depends upon the species of tree, the climatic 
conditions of the region, and the intended purpose of the timber.  The harvesting of timber (except when done on an 
extremely small scale) requires specialized machinery unique to the industry.  Establishments gathering forest 
products, such as gums, barks, balsam needles, rhizomes, fibers, Spanish moss, and ginseng and truffles, are also 
included in this subsector.

114 
 
   Industries in the Fishing, Hunting and Trapping subsector harvest fish and other wild animals from their natural 
habitats and are dependent upon a continued supply of the natural resource.  The harvesting of fish is the 
predominant economic activity of this subsector and it usually requires specialized vessels that, by the nature of their 
size, configuration and equipment, are not suitable for any other type of production, such as transportation.  
   Hunting and trapping activities utilize a wide variety of production processes and are classified in the same 
subsector as fishing because the availability of resources and the constraints imposed, such as conservation 
requirements and proper habitat maintenance, are similar.

The Sector as a Whole 

Sector 21--Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas ExtractionT 

 
   The Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector comprises establishments that extract naturally 
occurring mineral solids, such as coal and ores; liquid minerals, such as crude petroleum; and gases, such as natural 
gas.  The term mining is used in the broad sense to include quarrying, well operations, beneficiating (e.g., crushing, 
screening, washing, and flotation), and other preparation customarily performed at the mine site, or as a part of 
mining activity. 
   The Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector distinguishes two basic activities: mine operation and 
mining support activities.  Mine operation includes establishments operating mines, quarries, or oil and gas wells on 
their own account or for others on a contract or fee basis.  Mining support activities include establishments that 
perform exploration (except geophysical surveying) and/or other mining services on a contract or fee basis (except 
mine site preparation and construction of oil/gas pipelines). 
   Establishments in the Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector are grouped and classified according 
to the natural resource mined or to be mined.  Industries include establishments that develop the mine site, extract 
the natural resources, and/or those that beneficiate (i.e., prepare) the mineral mined.  Beneficiation is the process 
whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former 
suitable for further processing or direct use.  The operations that take place in beneficiation are primarily 
mechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, and centrifugal separation.  In contrast, manufacturing 
operations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as electrolysis and distillation.  However, 
some treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both the beneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e., 
smelting/refining) stages.  The range of preparation activities varies by mineral and the purity of any given ore 
deposit.  While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require little or no preparation, others are washed 
and screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed into bullion before leaving the mine site. 
   Mining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location.  Separate receipts will be 
collected for these activities whenever possible.  When receipts cannot be broken out between mining and 
manufacturing, establishments that mine or quarry nonmetallic minerals, and then beneficiate the nonmetallic 
minerals into more finished manufactured products are classified based on the primary activity of the establishment.  
A mine that manufactures a small amount of finished products will be classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, 
and Oil and Gas Extraction.  An establishment that mines whose primary output is a more finished manufactured 
product will be classified in Sector 31-33, Manufacturing. 
 
211 
 
   Industries in the Oil and Gas Extraction subsector operate and/or develop oil and gas field properties.  Such 
activities may include exploration for crude petroleum and natural gas; drilling, completing, and equipping wells; 
operating separators, emulsion breakers, desilting equipment, and field gathering lines for crude petroleum and 
natural gas; and all other activities in the preparation of oil and gas up to the point of shipment from the producing 
property.  This subsector includes the production of crude petroleum, the mining and extraction of oil from oil shale 
and oil sands, and the production of natural gas, sulfur recovery from natural gas, and recovery of hydrocarbon 
liquids. 
   Establishments in this subsector include those that operate oil and gas wells on their own account or for others on a 
contract or fee basis.  Establishments primarily engaged in providing support services, on a fee or contract basis, 
required for the drilling or operation of oil and gas wells (except geophysical surveying and mapping, mine site 
preparation, and construction of oil/gas pipelines) are classified in Subsector 213, Support Activities for Mining.

212  Mining (except Oil and Gas)T 
 
   Industries in the Mining (except Oil and Gas) subsector primarily engage in mining, mine site development, and 
beneficiating (i.e., preparing) metallic minerals and nonmetallic minerals, including coal.  The term "mining" is used 
in the broad sense to include ore extraction, quarrying, and beneficiating (e.g., crushing, screening, washing, sizing, 
concentrating, and flotation), customarily done at the mine site. 
   Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles which can be separated into 
mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  The operations that take place in 
beneficiation are primarily mechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, centrifugal separation, and 

so on. In contrast, manufacturing operations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as 
electrolysis, distillation, and so on.  However some treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both stages: the 
beneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e., smelting/refining) stages.  The range of preparation activities varies by 
mineral and the purity of any given ore deposit.  While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require 
little or no preparation, others are washed and screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed 
into bullion before leaving the mine site. 
   Establishments in the Mining (except Oil and Gas) subsector include those that have complete responsibility for 
operating mines and quarries (except oil and gas wells) and those that operate mines and quarries (except oil and gas 
wells) for others on a contract or fee basis.  Establishments primarily engaged in providing support services, on a

The Sector as a Whole 

Sector 23—ConstructionT 

 
   The Construction sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in the construction of buildings or 
engineering projects (e.g., highways and utility systems).  Establishments primarily engaged in the preparation of 
sites for new construction and establishments primarily engaged in subdividing land for sale as building sites also 
are included in this sector. 
   Construction work done may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs.  Activities of 
these establishments generally are managed at a fixed place of business, but they usually perform construction 
activities at multiple project sites.  Production responsibilities for establishments in this sector are usually specified 
in (1) contracts with the owners of construction projects (prime contracts) or (2) contracts with other construction 
establishments (subcontracts). 
   Establishments primarily engaged in contracts that include responsibility for all aspects of individual construction 
projects are commonly known as general contractors, but also may be known as design-builders, construction 
managers, turnkey contractors, or (in cases where two or more establishments jointly secure a general contract) 
joint-venture contractors.  Construction managers that provide oversight and scheduling only (i.e., agency) as well as 
construction managers that are responsible for the entire project (i.e., at risk) are included as general contractor type 
establishments.  Establishments of the "general contractor type" frequently arrange construction of separate parts of 
their projects through subcontracts with other construction establishments. 
   Establishments primarily engaged in activities to produce a specific component (e.g., masonry, painting, and 
electrical work) of a construction project are commonly known as specialty trade contractors.  Activities of specialty 
trade contractors are usually subcontracted from other construction establishments, but especially in remodeling and 
repair construction, the work may be done directly for the owner of the property. 
   Establishments primarily engaged in activities to construct buildings to be sold on sites that they own are known as 
for-sale builders, but also may be known as speculative builders or merchant builders.  For-sale builders produce 
buildings in a manner similar to general contractors, but their production processes also include site acquisition and 
securing of financial backing. For-sale builders are most often associated with the construction of residential 
buildings.  Like general contractors, they may subcontract all or part of the actual construction work on their 
buildings. 
   There are substantial differences in the types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by 
establishments in this sector.  To highlight these differences and variations in the underlying production functions, 
this sector is divided into three subsectors. 
    Subsector 236, Construction of Buildings, comprises establishments of the general contractor type and for-sale 
builders involved in the construction of buildings.  Subsector 237, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, 
comprises establishments involved in the construction of engineering projects. Subsector 238, Specialty Trade 
Contractors, comprises establishments engaged in specialty trade activities generally needed in the construction of 
all types of buildings. 
   Force account construction is construction work performed by an enterprise primarily engaged in some business 
other than construction for its own account, using employees of the enterprise.  This activity is not included in the 
construction sector unless the construction work performed is the primary activity of a separate establishment of the 
enterprise.  The installation and the ongoing repair and maintenance of telecommunications and utility networks is 
excluded from construction when the establishments performing the work are not independent contractors.  
Although a growing proportion of this work is subcontracted to independent contractors in the Construction sector, 
the operating units of telecommunications and utility companies performing this work are included with the 
telecommunications or utility activities. 
 
236 
 
   The Construction of Buildings subsector comprises establishments primarily responsible for the construction of 
buildings.  The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs.  The on-
site assembly of precut, panelized, and prefabricated buildings and construction of temporary buildings are included 
in this subsector.  Part or all of the production work for which the establishments in this subsector have 
responsibility may be subcontracted to other construction establishments--usually specialty trade contractors. 

Construction of BuildingsT 

   Establishments in this subsector are classified based on the types of buildings they construct.  This classification 
reflects variations in the requirements of the underlying production processes. 
 
2361  Residential Building ConstructionT 
 
23611  Residential Building ConstructionT 
 
   This industry comprises establishments primarily responsible for the construction or remodeling and renovation of 
single-family and multifamily residential buildings.  Included in this industry are residential housing general 
contractors (i.e., new construction, remodeling, or renovating existing residential structures), for-sale builders and 
remodelers of residential structures, residential project construction management firms, and residential design-build 
firms.

Heavy and Civil Engineering ConstructionT 

 
237 
 
   The Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction subsector comprises establishments whose primary activity is the 
construction of entire engineering projects (e.g., highways and dams), and specialty trade contractors, whose 
primary activity is the production of a specific component for such projects.  Specialty trade contractors in Heavy 
and Civil Engineering Construction generally are performing activities that are specific to heavy and civil 
engineering construction projects and are not normally performed on buildings.  The work performed may include 
new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs.  
   Specialty trade activities are classified in this subsector if the skills and equipment present are specific to heavy or 
civil engineering construction projects.  For example, specialized equipment is needed to paint lines on highways.  
This equipment is not normally used in building applications so the activity is classified in this subsector.  Traffic 
signal installation, while specific to highways, uses much of the same skills and equipment that are needed for 
electrical work in building projects and is therefore classified in Subsector 238, Specialty Trade Contractors. 
   Construction projects involving water resources (e.g., dredging and land drainage) and projects involving open 
space improvement (e.g., parks and trails) are included in this subsector.  Establishments whose primary activity is 
the subdivision of land into individual building lots usually perform various additional site-improvement activities 
(e.g., road building and utility line installation) and are included in this subsector.  
   Establishments in this subsector are classified based on the types of structures that they construct.  This 
classification reflects variations in the requirements of the underlying production processes.

Specialty Trade ContractorsT 

 
238 
 
   The Specialty Trade Contractors subsector comprises establishments whose primary activity is performing specific 
activities (e.g., pouring concrete, site preparation, plumbing, painting, and electrical work) involved in building 
construction or other activities that are similar for all types of construction, but that are not responsible for the entire 
project.  The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, maintenance, and repairs.  The 
production work performed by establishments in this subsector is usually subcontracted from establishments of the 

Foundation, Structure, and Building Exterior ContractorsT 

general contractor type or for-sale builders, but especially in remodeling and repair construction, work also may be 
done directly for the owner of the property.  Specialty trade contractors usually perform most of their work at the 
construction site, although they may have shops where they perform prefabrication and other work.  Establishments 
primarily engaged in preparing sites for new construction are also included in this subsector. 
   There are substantial differences in types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by specialty 
trade contractors.  Establishments in this subsector are classified based on the underlying production function for the 
specialty trade in which they specialize.  Throughout the Specialty Trade Contractors subsector, establishments 
commonly provide both the parts and labor required to complete work.  For example, electrical contractors supply 
the current-carrying and noncurrent-carrying wiring devices that are required to install a circuit.  Plumbing, heating, 
and air-conditioning contractors also supply the parts required to complete a contract.  
   Establishments that specialize in activities primarily related to heavy and civil engineering construction that are 
not normally performed on buildings, such as the painting of lines on highways are classified in Subsector 237, 
Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. 
   Establishments that are primarily engaged in selling construction materials are classified in Sector 42, Wholesale 
Trade, or Sector 44-45, Retail Trade, based on the characteristics of the selling unit.

The Sector as a Whole 

Sector 31-33—ManufacturingT 

 
   The Manufacturing sector comprises establishments engaged in the mechanical, physical, or chemical 
transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products.  The assembling of component parts of 
manufactured products is considered manufacturing, except in cases where the activity is appropriately classified in 
Sector 23, Construction. 
   Establishments in the Manufacturing sector are often described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically 
use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment.  However, establishments that transform materials or 
substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public 
products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors, 
may also be included in this sector.  Manufacturing establishments may process materials or may contract with other 
establishments to process their materials for them.  Both types of establishments are included in manufacturing. 
   The materials, substances, or components transformed by manufacturing establishments are raw materials that are 
products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing 
establishments.  The materials used may be purchased directly from producers, obtained through customary trade 
channels, or secured without recourse to the market by transferring the product from one establishment to another, 
under the same ownership. 
   The new product of a manufacturing establishment may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization or 
consumption, or it may be semifinished to become an input for an establishment engaged in further manufacturing.  
For example, the product of the alumina refinery is the input used in the primary production of aluminum; primary 
aluminum is the input to an aluminum wire drawing plant; and aluminum wire is the input for a fabricated wire 
product manufacturing establishment. 
   The subsectors in the Manufacturing sector generally reflect distinct production processes related to material 
inputs, production equipment, and employee skills. In the machinery area, where assembling is a key activity, parts 
and accessories for manufactured products are classified in the industry of the finished manufactured item when they 
are made for separate sale.  For example, a replacement refrigerator door would be classified with refrigerators and 
an attachment for a piece of metal working machinery would be classified with metal working machinery.  
However, components, input from other manufacturing establishments, are classified based on the production 
function of the component manufacturer.  For example, electronic components are classified in Subsector 334, 
Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing and stampings are classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal 
Product Manufacturing. 
   Manufacturing establishments often perform one or more activities that are classified outside the Manufacturing 
sector of NAICS.  For instance, almost all manufacturing has some captive research and development or 
administrative operations, such as accounting, payroll, or management.  These captive services are treated the same 
as captive manufacturing activities.  When the services are provided by separate establishments, they are classified 
to the NAICS sector where such services are primary, not in manufacturing.  
   The boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry.  The 
establishments in the manufacturing sector are engaged in the transformation of materials into new products.  Their 
output is a new product.  However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective.  As 
clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in NAICS: 
 
Milk bottling and pasteurizing;                                            Grinding of lenses to prescription; 
Water bottling and processing;                                            Wood preserving; 
Fresh fish packaging (oyster shucking,                               Electroplating, plating, metal heat  
  fish filleting);                                                                        treating, and polishing for the trade; 
Apparel jobbing (assigning of materials                              Lapidary work for the trade; 
  to contract factories or shops for                                        Fabricating signs and advertising displays; 
  fabrication or other contract operations)                            Rebuilding or remanufacturing  
  as well as contracting on materials owned by others;          machinery (i.e., automotive parts); 
Printing and related activities;                                             Ship repair and renovation; 
Ready-mixed concrete production;                                     Machine shops; and 
Leather converting;                                                             Tire retreading. 
 

   Conversely, there are activities that are sometimes considered manufacturing, but which for NAICS are classified 
in another sector (i.e., not classified as manufacturing). They include: 
 
   1. Logging, classified in Sector 11, Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, is considered a harvesting 
operation; 
 
   2. The beneficiating of ores and other minerals, classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas 
Extraction, is considered part of the activity of mining; 
 
   3. The construction of structures and fabricating operations performed at the site of construction by contractors, is 
classified in Sector 23, Construction; 
 
   4. Establishments engaged in breaking of bulk and redistribution in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, 
or bottling products, such as liquors or chemicals; the customized assembly of computers; sorting of scrap; mixing 
paints to customer order; and cutting metals to customer order, classified in Sector 42, Wholesale Trade or Sector 
44-45, Retail Trade, produce a modified version of the same product, not a new product; and 
 
   5. Publishing and the combined activity of publishing and printing, classified in Sector 51, Information, perform 
the transformation of information into a product whereas the value of the product to the consumer lies in the 
information content, not in the format in which it is distributed (i.e., the book or software diskette). 
 
311 
 
   Industries in the Food Manufacturing subsector transform livestock and agricultural products into products for 
intermediate or final consumption.  The industry groups are distinguished by the raw materials (generally of animal 
or vegetable origin) processed into food products. 
   The food products manufactured in these establishments are typically sold to wholesalers or retailers for 
distribution to consumers, but establishments primarily engaged in retailing bakery and candy products made on the 
premises not for immediate consumption are included. 
   Establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing beverages are classified in Subsector 312, Beverage and 
Tobacco Product Manufacturing.

Beverage and Tobacco Product ManufacturingT 

 
312 
 
   Industries in the Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing subsector manufacture beverages and tobacco 
products.  The industry group, Beverage Manufacturing, includes three types of establishments: (1) those that 
manufacture nonalcoholic beverages; (2) those that manufacture alcoholic beverages through the fermentation 
process; and (3) those that produce distilled alcoholic beverages.  Ice manufacturing, while not a beverage, is 
included with nonalcoholic beverage manufacturing because it uses the same production process as water 
purification. 
   In the case of activities related to the manufacture of beverages, the structure follows the defined production 
processes.  Brandy, a distilled beverage, was not placed under distillery product manufacturing, but rather under the 
NAICS class for winery product manufacturing since the production process used in the manufacturing of alcoholic 
grape-based beverages produces both wines (fermented beverage) and brandies (distilled beverage). 
   The industry group, Tobacco Manufacturing, includes two types of establishments: (1) those engaged in redrying 
and stemming tobacco and, (2) those that manufacture tobacco products, such as cigarettes and cigars. 
 
3121 
 
31211  Soft Drink and Ice ManufacturingT 
 
   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in one or more of the following: (1) manufacturing soft 
drinks; (2) manufacturing ice; and (3) purifying and bottling water.

Textile MillsT 

 
313 
 
   Industries in the Textile Mills subsector group establishments that transform a basic fiber (natural or synthetic) 
into a product, such as yarn or fabric that is further manufactured into usable items, such as apparel, sheets, towels, 
and textile bags for individual or industrial consumption.  The further manufacturing may be performed in the same 
establishment and classified in this subsector, or it may be performed at a separate establishment and be classified 
elsewhere in manufacturing.  
   The main processes in this subsector include preparation and spinning of fiber, knitting or weaving of fabric, and 
the finishing of the textile.  The NAICS structure follows and captures this process flow. Major industries in this 

Fiber, Yarn, and Thread MillsT 

See industry description for 313110 below. 

flow, such as preparation of fibers, weaving of fabric, knitting of fabric, and fiber and fabric finishing, are uniquely 
identified.  Texturizing, throwing, twisting, and winding of yarn contains aspects of both fiber preparation and fiber 
finishing and is classified with preparation of fibers rather than with finishing of fiber.  
   NAICS separates the manufacturing of primary textiles and the manufacturing of textile products (except apparel) 
when the textile product is produced from purchased primary textiles, such as fabric.  The manufacturing of textile 
products (except apparel) from purchased fabric is classified in Subsector 314, Textile Product Mills, and apparel 
from purchased fabric is classified in Subsector 315, Apparel Manufacturing.  
   Excluded from this subsector are establishments that weave or knit fabric and make garments. These 
establishments are included in Subsector 315, Apparel Manufacturing.

substitute" products included in this group.  The products made from leather substitutes are included in this 
subsector because they are made in similar ways leather products are made (e.g., luggage).  They are made in the 
same establishments, so it is not practical to separate them. 
   The inclusion of leather making in this subsector is partly because leather tanning is a relatively small industry that 
has few close neighbors as a production process, partly because leather is an input to some of the other products 
classified in this subsector and partly for historical reasons.

   Industries in the Wood Product Manufacturing subsector manufacture wood products, such as lumber, plywood, 
veneers, wood containers, wood flooring, wood trusses, manufactured homes (i.e., mobile homes), and prefabricated 
wood buildings.  The production processes of the Wood Product Manufacturing subsector include sawing, planing, 
shaping, laminating, and assembling of wood products starting from logs that are cut into bolts, or lumber that then 
may be further cut, or shaped by lathes or other shaping tools.  The lumber or other transformed wood shapes may 
also be subsequently planed or smoothed, and assembled into finished products, such as wood containers.  The 
Wood Product Manufacturing subsector includes establishments that make wood products from logs and bolts that 
are sawed and shaped, and establishments that purchase sawed lumber and make wood products.  With the exception 
of sawmills and wood preservation establishments, the establishments are grouped into industries mainly based on 
the specific products manufactured.

Paper ManufacturingT 

 
322 
 
   Industries in the Paper Manufacturing subsector make pulp, paper, or converted paper products.  The 
manufacturing of these products is grouped together because they constitute a series of vertically connected 
processes.  More than one is often carried out in a single establishment.  There are essentially three activities.  The 
manufacturing of pulp involves separating the cellulose fibers from other impurities in wood or used paper.  The 
manufacturing of paper involves matting these fibers into a sheet.  Converted paper products are made from paper 
and other materials by various cutting and shaping techniques and includes coating and laminating activities. 
   The Paper Manufacturing subsector is subdivided into two industry groups, the first for the manufacturing of pulp 
and paper and the second for the manufacturing of converted paper products.  Paper making is treated as the core 
activity of the subsector.  Therefore, any establishment that makes paper (including paperboard), either alone or in 
combination with pulp manufacturing or paper converting, is classified as a paper or paperboard mill.  
Establishments that make pulp without making paper are classified as pulp mills.  Pulp mills, paper mills and 
paperboard mills comprise the first industry group. 
   Establishments that make products from purchased paper and other materials make up the second industry group, 
Converted Paper Product Manufacturing.  This general activity is then subdivided based, for the most part, on 
process distinctions.  Paperboard container manufacturing uses corrugating, cutting, and shaping machinery to form 
paperboard into containers.  Paper bag and coated and treated paper manufacturing establishments cut and coat 
paper and foil.  Stationery product manufacturing establishments make a variety of paper products used for writing, 
filing, and similar applications.  Other converted paper product manufacturing includes, in particular, the conversion 
of sanitary paper stock into such things as tissue paper and disposable diapers.  
   An important process used in the Paper Bag and Coated and Treated Paper Manufacturing industry is lamination, 
often combined with coating.  Lamination and coating makes a composite material with improved properties of 
strength, impermeability, and so on.  The laminated materials may be paper, metal foil, or plastics film. While paper 
is often one of the components, it is not always.  Lamination of plastics film to plastics film is classified in the 
NAICS Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing, because establishments that do this often first 

make the film.  The same situation holds with respect to bags.  The manufacturing of bags from plastics only, 
whether or not laminated, is classified in Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing, but all other 
bag manufacturing is classified in this subsector.  
   Excluded from this subsector are photosensitive papers.  These papers are chemically treated and are classified in 
Industry 32599, All Other Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing.

Printing and Related Support ActivitiesT 

 
323 
 
   Industries in the Printing and Related Support Activities subsector print products, such as newspapers, books, 
labels, business cards, stationery, business forms, and other materials, and perform support activities, such as data 
imaging, platemaking services, and bookbinding.  The support activities included here are an integral part of the 
printing industry, and a product (a printing plate, a bound book, or a computer disk or file) that is an integral part of 
the printing industry is almost always provided by these operations.  
   Processes used in printing include a variety of methods used to transfer an image from a plate, screen, film, or 
computer file to some medium, such as paper, plastics, metal, textile articles, or wood.  The printing processes 
employed include, but are not limited to, lithographic, gravure, screen, flexographic, digital, and letterpress.  
   In contrast to many other classification systems that locate publishing of printed materials in manufacturing, 
NAICS classifies the publishing of printed products in Subsector 511, Publishing Industries (except Internet).  
Though printing and publishing are often carried out by the same enterprise (a newspaper, for example), it is less 
and less the case that these distinct activities are carried out in the same establishment.  When publishing and 
printing are done in the same establishment, the establishment is classified in Sector 51, Information, in the 
appropriate NAICS industry even if the receipts for printing exceed those for publishing.  
   This subsector includes printing on clothing because the production process for that activity is printing, not 
clothing manufacturing.  For instance, the printing of T-shirts is included in this subsector. In contrast, printing on 
fabric (or grey goods) is not included.  This activity is part of the process of finishing the fabric and is included in 
the NAICS Textile Mills subsector in Industry 31331, Textile and Fabric Finishing Mills.

manufacture the stock that they print, but may perform postprinting activities, such as folding, cutting, or laminating 
the materials they print, and mailing.

Chemical ManufacturingT 

 
325 
 
   The Chemical Manufacturing subsector is based on the transformation of organic and inorganic raw materials by a 
chemical process and the formulation of products.  This subsector distinguishes the production of basic chemicals 
that comprise the first industry group from the production of intermediate and end products produced by further 
processing of basic chemicals that make up the remaining industry groups.  
   This subsector does not include all industries transforming raw materials by a chemical process.  It is common for 
some chemical processing to occur during mining operations.  These beneficiating operations, such as copper 
concentrating, are classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.  Furthermore, the refining 
of crude petroleum is included in Subsector 324, Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing.  In addition, the 
manufacturing of aluminum oxide is included in Subsector 331, Primary Metal Manufacturing; and beverage 
distilleries are classified in Subsector 312, Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing.  As is the case of these 
two activities, the grouping of industries into subsectors may take into account the association of the activities 
performed with other activities in the subsector. 
 
3251 
 
   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing chemicals using basic 
processes, such as thermal cracking and distillation.  Chemicals manufactured in this industry group are usually 
separate chemical elements or separate chemically-defined compounds.

Plastics and Rubber Products ManufacturingT  

   Industries in the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector make goods by processing plastics 
materials and raw rubber.  The core technology employed by establishments in this subsector is that of plastics or 
rubber product production.  Plastics and rubber are combined in the same subsector because plastics are increasingly 
being used as a substitute for rubber; however the subsector is generally restricted to the production of products 
made of just one material, either solely plastics or rubber.  
   Many manufacturing activities use plastics or rubber, for example the manufacture of footwear, or furniture.  
Typically, the production process of these products involves more than one material. In these cases, technologies 
that allow disparate materials to be formed and combined are of central importance in describing the manufacturing 
activity.  In NAICS, such activities (the footwear and furniture manufacturing) are not classified in the Plastics and 
Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector because the core technologies for these activities are diverse and involve 
multiple materials.  
   Within the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector, a distinction is made between plastics and 
rubber products at the industry group level, although it is not a rigid distinction, as can be seen from the definition of 
Industry 32622, Rubber and Plastics Hoses and Belting Manufacturing.  As materials technology progresses, plastics 
are increasingly being used as a substitute for rubber; and eventually, the distinction may disappear as a basis for 
establishment classification.  
   In keeping with the core technology focus of plastics, lamination of plastics film to plastics film as well as the 
production of bags from plastics only is classified in this subsector.  Lamination and bag production involving 
plastics and materials other than plastics are classified in the NAICS Subsector 322, Paper Manufacturing.

Nonmetallic Mineral Product ManufacturingT 

 
327 
 
   The Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector transforms mined or quarried nonmetallic minerals, 
such as sand, gravel, stone, clay, and refractory materials, into products for intermediate or final consumption.  
Processes used include grinding, mixing, cutting, shaping, and honing.  Heat often is used in the process and 
chemicals are frequently mixed to change the composition, purity, and chemical properties for the intended product.  
For example, glass is produced by heating silica sand to the melting point (sometimes combined with cullet or 
recycled glass) and then drawn, floated, or blow molded to the desired shape or thickness.  Refractory materials are 
heated and then formed into bricks or other shapes for use in industrial applications.  
   The Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector includes establishments that manufacture products, 
such as bricks, refractories, ceramic products, and glass and glass products, such as plate glass and containers.  Also 
included are cement and concrete products, lime, gypsum and other nonmetallic mineral products including abrasive 
products, ceramic plumbing fixtures, statuary, cut stone products, and mineral wool.  The products are used in a 
wide range of activities from construction and heavy and light manufacturing to articles for personal use.  
   Mining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location.  Separate receipts will be 
collected for these activities whenever possible.  When receipts cannot be broken out between mining and 
manufacturing, establishments that mine or quarry nonmetallic minerals, beneficiate the nonmetallic minerals and 
further process the nonmetallic minerals into a more finished manufactured product are classified based on the 
primary activity of the establishment.  A mine that manufactures a small amount of finished products will be 
classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.  An establishment that mines whose primary 
output is a more finished manufactured product will be classified in the Manufacturing Sector.  
   Excluded from the Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector are establishments that primarily 
beneficiate mined nonmetallic minerals.  Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to 
particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  
Beneficiation establishments are included in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.

Primary Metal ManufacturingT 

 
331 
 
   Industries in the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector smelt and/or refine ferrous and nonferrous metals from 
ore, pig or scrap, using electrometallurgical and other process metallurgical techniques.  Establishments in this 
subsector also manufacture metal alloys and superalloys by introducing other chemical elements to pure metals.  The 
output of smelting and refining, usually in ingot form, is used in rolling, drawing, and extruding operations to make 
sheet, strip, bar, rod, or wire, and in molten form to make castings and other basic metal products.  
   Primary manufacturing of ferrous and nonferrous metals begins with ore or concentrate as the primary input.  
Establishments manufacturing primary metals from ore and/or concentrate remain classified in the primary smelting, 
primary refining, or iron and steel mill industries regardless of the form of their output.  Establishments primarily 
engaged in secondary smelting and/or secondary refining recover ferrous and nonferrous metals from scrap and/or 
dross.  The output of the secondary smelting and/or secondary refining industries is limited to shapes such as ingot 
or billet that will be further processed.  Recovery of metals from scrap often occurs in establishments that are 
primarily engaged in activities, such as rolling, drawing, extruding, or similar processes.  
   Excluded from the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector are establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing 
ferrous and nonferrous forgings (except ferrous forgings made in steel mills) and stampings.  Although forging, 
stamping, and casting are all methods used to make metal shapes, forging and stamping do not use molten metals 
and are included in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.  Establishments primarily engaged in 
operating coke ovens are classified in Industry 32419, Other Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing.

Fabricated Metal Product ManufacturingT 

 
332 
 
   Industries in the Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing subsector transform metal into intermediate or end 
products, other than machinery, computers and electronics, and metal furniture, or treat metals and metal formed 
products fabricated elsewhere.  Important fabricated metal processes are forging, stamping, bending, forming, and 
machining, used to shape individual pieces of metal; and other processes, such as welding and assembling, used to 
join separate parts together.  Establishments in this subsector may use one of these processes or a combination of 
these processes.  
   The NAICS structure for this subsector distinguishes the forging and stamping processes in a single industry.  The 
remaining industries in the subsector group establishments based on similar combinations of processes used to make 
products.  
   The manufacturing performed in the Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing subsector begins with manufactured 
metal shapes.  The establishments in this subsector further fabricate the purchased metal shapes into a product.  For 
instance, the Spring and Wire Product Manufacturing industry starts with wire and fabricates such items.  
   Within manufacturing there are other establishments that make the same products made by this subsector; only 
these establishments begin production further back in the production process.  These establishments have a more 
integrated operation.  For instance, one establishment may manufacture steel, draw it into wire, and make wire 
products in the same establishment.  Such operations are classified in the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector.

333  Machinery ManufacturingT 
 
   Industries in the Machinery Manufacturing subsector create end products that apply mechanical force, for 
example, the application of gears and levers, to perform work.  Some important processes for the manufacture of 
machinery are forging, stamping, bending, forming, and machining that are used to shape individual pieces of metal.  
Processes, such as welding and assembling are used to join separate parts together.  Although these processes are 
similar to those used in metal fabricating establishments, machinery manufacturing is different because it typically 
employs multiple metal forming processes in manufacturing the various parts of the machine.  Moreover, complex 
assembly operations are an inherent part of the production process.  
   In general, design considerations are very important in machinery production. Establishments specialize in making 
machinery designed for particular applications.  Thus, design is considered to be part of the production process for 
the purpose of implementing NAICS.  The NAICS structure reflects this by defining industries and industry groups 
that make machinery for different applications.  A broad distinction exists between machinery that is generally used 
in a variety of industrial applications (i.e., general purpose machinery) and machinery that is designed to be used in 
a particular industry (i.e., special purpose machinery).  Three industry groups consist of special purpose machinery--
Agricultural, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing; Industrial Machinery Manufacturing; and 
Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing.  The other industry groups make general-purpose 
machinery: Ventilation, Heating, Air-Conditioning, and Commercial Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturing; 
Metalworking Machinery Manufacturing; Engine, Turbine, and Power Transmission Equipment Manufacturing; and 
Other General Purpose Machinery Manufacturing.

Computer and Electronic Product ManufacturingT 

 
334 
 
   Industries in the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector group establishments that manufacture 
computers, computer peripherals, communications equipment, and similar electronic products, and establishments 
that manufacture components for such products.  The Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing industries 
have been combined in the hierarchy of NAICS because of the economic significance they have attained.  Their 

rapid growth suggests that they will become even more important to the economies of all three North American 
countries in the future, and in addition their manufacturing processes are fundamentally different from the 
manufacturing processes of other machinery and equipment.  The design and use of integrated circuits and the 
application of highly specialized miniaturization technologies are common elements in the production technologies 
of the computer and electronic subsector.  Convergence of technology motivates this NAICS subsector.  
Digitalization of sound recording, for example, causes both the medium (the compact disc) and the equipment to 
resemble the technologies for recording, storing, transmitting, and manipulating data.  Communications technology 
and equipment have been converging with computer technology.  When technologically-related components are in 
the same sector, it makes it easier to adjust the classification for future changes, without needing to redefine its basic 
structure.  The creation of the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector assists in delineating new 
and emerging industries because the activities that will serve as the probable sources of new industries, such as 
computer manufacturing and communications equipment manufacturing, or computers and audio equipment, are 
brought together.  As new activities emerge, they are less likely therefore, to cross the subsector boundaries of the 
classification.

computers, such as mainframes, personal computers, workstations, laptops, and computer servers; and computer 
peripheral equipment, such as storage devices, printers, monitors, input/output devices and terminals.  Computers 
can be analog, digital, or hybrid.  Digital computers, the most common type, are devices that do all of the following: 
(1) store the processing program or programs and the data immediately necessary for the execution of the program; 
(2) can be freely programmed in accordance with the requirements of the user; (3) perform arithmetical 
computations specified by the user; and (4) execute, without human intervention, a processing program that requires 
the computer to modify its execution by logical decision during the processing run.  Analog computers are capable 
of simulating mathematical models and comprise at least analog, control, and programming elements.

Transportation Equipment ManufacturingT 

 
336 
 
   Industries in the Transportation Equipment Manufacturing subsector produce equipment for transporting people 
and goods.  Transportation equipment is a type of machinery.  An entire subsector is devoted to this activity because 
of the significance of its economic size in all three North American countries.  
   Establishments in this subsector utilize production processes similar to those of other machinery manufacturing 
establishments—bending, forming, welding, machining, and assembling metal or plastic parts into components and 
finished products.  However, the assembly of components and subassemblies and their further assembly into 
finished vehicles tends to be a more common production process in this subsector than in the Machinery 
Manufacturing subsector.  
   NAICS has industry groups for the manufacture of equipment for each mode of transport—road, rail, air and 
water.  Parts for motor vehicles warrant a separate industry group because of their importance and because parts 
manufacture requires less assembly, and the establishments that manufacture only parts are not as vertically 
integrated as those that make complete vehicles.  
   Land use motor vehicle equipment not designed for highway operation (e.g., agricultural equipment, construction 
equipment, and materials handling equipment) is classified in the appropriate NAICS subsector based on the type 
and use of the equipment.

Furniture and Related Product ManufacturingT 

 
337 
 
   Industries in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector make furniture and related articles, such 
as mattresses, window blinds, cabinets, and fixtures.  The processes used in the manufacture of furniture include the 
cutting, bending, molding, laminating, and assembly of such materials as wood, metal, glass, plastics, and rattan.  
However, the production process for furniture is not solely bending metal, cutting and shaping wood, or extruding 
and molding plastics.  Design and fashion trends play an important part in the production of furniture.  The 
integrated design of the article for both esthetic and functional qualities is also a major part of the process of 
manufacturing furniture.  Design services may be performed by the furniture establishment's work force or may be 
purchased from industrial designers. 
   Furniture may be made of any material, but the most common ones used in North America are metal and wood.  
Furniture manufacturing establishments may specialize in making articles primarily from one material.  Some of the 
equipment required to make a wooden table, for example, is different from that used to make a metal one.  However, 
furniture is usually made from several materials.  A wooden table might have metal brackets, and a wooden chair a 
fabric or plastics seat.  Therefore, in NAICS, furniture initially is classified based on the type of furniture 
(application for which it is designed) rather than the material used.  For example, an upholstered sofa is treated as 
household furniture, although it may also be used in hotels or offices.  
   When classifying furniture according to the component material from which it is made, furniture made from more 
than one material is classified based on the material used in the frame, or if there is no frame, the predominant 
component material.  Upholstered household furniture (excluding kitchen and dining room chairs with upholstered 
seats) is classified without regard to the frame material.  Kitchen or dining room chairs with upholstered seats are 
classified according to the frame material. 
   Furniture may be made on a stock or custom basis and may be shipped assembled or unassembled (i.e., 
knockdown).  The manufacture of furniture parts and frames is included in this subsector. 
   Some of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of 
manufacturing.  For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in 
Subsector 321, Wood Product Manufacturing.  However, the multiple processes that distinguish wood furniture 
manufacturing from wood product manufacturing warrant inclusion of wooden furniture manufacturing in the 
Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector.  Metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also 
employed in the manufacturing of roll-formed products classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product 
Manufacturing.  The molding process for plastics furniture is similar to the molding of other plastics products.  
However, plastics furniture producing establishments tend to specialize in furniture.  
   NAICS attempts to keep furniture manufacturing together, but there are two notable exceptions: seating for 
transportation equipment and specialized hospital furniture (e.g., hospital beds and operating tables).  These 
exceptions are related to the fact that some of the aspects of the production process for these products, primarily the 
design, are highly integrated with the other manufactured goods, namely motor vehicles and health equipment.

339  Miscellaneous ManufacturingT 
 
   Industries in the Miscellaneous Manufacturing subsector make a wide range of products that cannot readily be 
classified in specific NAICS subsectors in manufacturing.  Processes used by these establishments vary 
significantly, both among and within industries.  For example, a variety of manufacturing processes are used in 
manufacturing sporting and athletic goods that include products such as tennis racquets and golf balls.  The 
processes for these products differ from each other, and the processes differ significantly from the fabrication 
processes used in making dolls or toys, the melting and shaping of precious metals to make jewelry, and the 
bending, forming, and assembly used in making medical products. 
   The industries in this subsector are defined by what is made rather than how it is made.  Although individual 
establishments might be appropriately classified elsewhere in the NAICS structure, for historical continuity, these 
product-based industries were maintained.  In most cases, no one process or material predominates for an industry. 
   Establishments in this subsector manufacture products as diverse as medical equipment and supplies, jewelry, 
sporting goods, toys, and office supplies.

The Sector as a Whole 

Sector 42--Wholesale TradeT 

 
   The Wholesale Trade sector comprises establishments engaged in wholesaling merchandise, generally without 
transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise.  The merchandise described in this 
sector includes the outputs of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and certain information industries, such as 
publishing. 
   The wholesaling process is an intermediate step in the distribution of merchandise.  Wholesalers are organized to 
sell or arrange the purchase or sale of (a) goods for resale (i.e., goods sold to other wholesalers or retailers), (b) 
capital or durable nonconsumer goods, and (c) raw and intermediate materials and supplies used in production. 
   Wholesalers sell merchandise to other businesses and normally operate from a warehouse or office.  These 
warehouses and offices are characterized by having little or no display of merchandise.  In addition, neither the 
design nor the location of the premises is intended to solicit walk-in traffic.  Wholesalers do not normally use 
advertising directed to the general public.  Customers are generally reached initially via telephone, in-person 
marketing, or by specialized advertising that may include Internet and other electronic means.  Follow-up orders are 
either vendor-initiated or client-initiated, generally based on previous sales, and typically exhibit strong ties between 
sellers and buyers.  In fact, transactions are often conducted between wholesalers and clients that have long-standing 
business relationships. 
   This sector comprises two main types of wholesalers: merchant wholesalers that sell goods on their own account 
and business-to-business electronic markets, agents, and brokers that arrange sales and purchases for others 
generally for a commission or fee. 
   (1)   Establishments that sell goods on their own account are known as wholesale merchants, distributors, jobbers, 
drop shippers, and import/export merchants.  Also included as wholesale merchants are sales offices and sales 
branches (but not retail stores) maintained by manufacturing, refining, or mining enterprises apart from their plants 
or mines for the purpose of marketing their products and group purchasing organizations (e.g., purchasing and 
selling goods on their own account).  Merchant wholesale establishments typically maintain their own warehouse, 
where they receive and handle goods for their customers.  Goods are generally sold without transformation, but may 
include integral functions, such as sorting, packaging, labeling, and other marketing services. 
   (2)   Establishments arranging for the purchase or sale of goods owned by others or purchasing goods, generally on 
a commission basis are known as business-to-business electronic markets, agents and brokers, commission 
merchants, import/export agents and brokers, auction companies, group purchasing organization (e.g., purchasing or 
arranging for the purchases of goods owned by others), and manufacturers' representatives.  These establishments 
operate from offices and generally do not own or handle the goods they sell. 
   Some wholesale establishments may be connected with a single manufacturer and promote and sell the particular 
manufacturers' products to a wide range of other wholesalers or retailers.  Other wholesalers may be connected to a 
retail chain, or limited number of retail chains, and only provide a variety of products needed by that particular retail 
operation(s).  These wholesalers may obtain the products from a wide range of manufacturers.  Still other 
wholesalers may not take title to the goods, but act as agents and brokers for a commission. 
   Although, in general, wholesaling normally denotes sales in large volumes, durable nonconsumer goods may be 
sold in single units.  Sales of capital or durable nonconsumer goods used in the production of goods and services, 
such as farm machinery, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and industrial machinery, are always included in 
wholesale trade. 
 
423  Merchant Wholesalers, Durable Goods  
 
   Industries in the Merchant Wholesalers, Durable Goods subsector sell capital or durable goods to other businesses.  
Merchant wholesalers generally take title to the goods that they sell; in other words, they buy and sell goods on their 
own account.  Durable goods are new or used items generally with a normal life expectancy of three years or more.  
Durable goods merchant wholesale trade establishments are engaged in wholesaling products, such as motor 
vehicles, furniture, construction materials, machinery and equipment (including household-type appliances), metals 
and minerals (except petroleum), sporting goods, toys and hobby goods, recyclable materials, and parts. 
   Business-to-business electronic markets, agents, and brokers primarily engaged in wholesaling durable goods, 
generally on a commission or fee basis, are classified in Subsector 425, Wholesale Electronic Markets and Agents 
and Brokers.

The Sector as a Whole 

Sector 44-45--Retail TradeT 

 
   The Retail Trade sector comprises establishments engaged in retailing merchandise, generally without 
transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise. 
   The retailing process is the final step in the distribution of merchandise; retailers are, therefore, organized to sell 
merchandise in small quantities to the general public.  This sector comprises two main types of retailers: store and 
nonstore retailers. 
 
1.   Store retailers operate fixed point-of-sale locations, located and designed to attract a high volume of walk-in 
customers.  In general, retail stores have extensive displays of merchandise and use mass-media advertising to 
attract customers.  They typically sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption, but 
some also serve business and institutional clients.  These include establishments, such as office supply stores, 
computer and software stores, building materials dealers, plumbing supply stores, and electrical supply stores.  
Catalog showrooms, gasoline stations, automotive dealers, and mobile home dealers are treated as store retailers. 
   In addition to retailing merchandise, some types of store retailers are also engaged in the provision of after-sales 
services, such as repair and installation.  For example, new automobile dealers, electronics and appliance stores, and 
musical instrument and supplies stores often provide repair services.  As a general rule, establishments engaged in 
retailing merchandise and providing after-sales services are classified in this sector. 
   The first eleven subsectors of retail trade are store retailers.  The establishments are grouped into industries and 
industry groups typically based on one or more of the following criteria: 
 
   (a) The merchandise line or lines carried by the store; for example, specialty stores are distinguished from general-
line stores. 
 
   (b) The usual trade designation of the establishments.  This criterion applies in cases where a store type is well 
recognized by the industry and the public, but difficult to define strictly in terms of merchandise lines carried; for 
example, pharmacies, hardware stores, and department stores. 
 
   (c) Capital requirements in terms of display equipment; for example, food stores have equipment requirements not 
found in other retail industries. 
 
   (d) Human resource requirements in terms of expertise; for example, the staff of an automobile dealer requires 
knowledge in financing, registering, and licensing issues that are not necessary in other retail industries. 
 
2.   Nonstore retailers, like store retailers, are organized to serve the general public, but their retailing methods 
differ.  The establishments of this subsector reach customers and market merchandise with methods, such as the 
broadcasting of "infomercials," the broadcasting and publishing of direct-response advertising, the publishing of 
paper and electronic catalogs, door-to-door solicitation, in-home demonstration, selling from portable stalls (street 
vendors, except food), and distribution through vending machines.  Establishments engaged in the direct sale 
(nonstore) of products, such as home heating oil dealers and home delivery newspaper routes are included here. 
   The buying of goods for resale is a characteristic of retail trade establishments that particularly distinguishes them 
from establishments in the agriculture, manufacturing, and construction industries.  For example, farms that sell their 
products at or from the point of production are not classified in retail, but rather in agriculture.  Similarly, 
establishments that both manufacture and sell their products to the general public are not classified in retail, but 
rather in manufacturing.  However, establishments that engage in processing activities incidental to retailing are 
classified in retail.  This includes establishments, such as optical goods stores that do in-store grinding of lenses, and 
meat and seafood markets. 
   Wholesalers also engage in the buying of goods for resale, but they are not usually organized to serve the general 
public.  They typically operate from a warehouse or office and neither the design nor the location of these premises 
is intended to solicit a high volume of walk-in traffic.  Wholesalers supply institutional, industrial, wholesale, and 
retail clients; their operations are, therefore, generally organized to purchase, sell, and deliver merchandise in larger 
quantities.  However, dealers of durable nonconsumer goods, such as farm machinery and heavy-duty trucks, are 
included in wholesale trade even if they often sell these products in single units. 

 
441  Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers  
 
   Industries in the Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers subsector retail motor vehicles and parts from fixed point-of-sale 
locations.  Establishments in this subsector typically operate from a showroom and/or an open lot where the vehicles 
are on display.  The display of vehicles and the related parts require little by way of display equipment.  The 
personnel generally include both the sales and sales support staff familiar with the requirements for registering and 
financing a vehicle as well as a staff of parts experts and mechanics trained to provide repair and maintenance 
services for the vehicles.  Specific industries have been included in this subsector to identify the type of vehicle 
being retailed.

Sector 48-49--Transportation and WarehousingT 

 

The Sector as a Whole 

 
   The Transportation and Warehousing sector includes industries providing transportation of passengers and cargo, 
warehousing and storage for goods, scenic and sightseeing transportation, and support activities related to modes of 
transportation.  Establishments in these industries use transportation equipment or transportation related facilities as 
a productive asset.  The type of equipment depends on the mode of transportation.  The modes of transportation are 
air, rail, water, road, and pipeline. 
   The Transportation and Warehousing sector distinguishes three basic types of activities: subsectors for each mode 
of transportation, a subsector for warehousing and storage, and a subsector for establishments providing support 
activities for transportation.  In addition, there are subsectors for establishments that provide passenger 
transportation for scenic and sightseeing purposes, postal services, and courier services. 
   A separate subsector for support activities is established in the sector because, first, support activities for 
transportation are inherently multimodal, such as freight transportation arrangement, or have multimodal aspects.  
Secondly, there are production process similarities among the support activity industries. 
   One of the support activities identified in the support activity subsector is the routine repair and maintenance of 
transportation equipment (e.g., aircraft at an airport, railroad rolling stock at a railroad terminal, or ships at a harbor 
or port facility).  Such establishments do not perform complete overhauling or rebuilding of transportation 
equipment (i.e., periodic restoration of transportation equipment to original design specifications) or transportation 
equipment conversion (i.e., major modification to systems).  An establishment that primarily performs factory (or 
shipyard) overhauls, rebuilding, or conversions of aircraft, railroad rolling stock, or a ship is classified in Subsector 
336, Transportation Equipment Manufacturing according to the type of equipment. 
   Many of the establishments in this sector often operate on networks, with physical facilities, labor forces, and 
equipment spread over an extensive geographic area. 
   Warehousing establishments in this sector are distinguished from merchant wholesaling in that the warehouse 
establishments do not sell the goods. 
   Excluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in providing travel agent services that support 
transportation and other establishments, such as hotels, businesses, and government agencies.  These establishments 
are classified in Sector 56, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services.  Also, 
establishments primarily engaged in providing rental and leasing of transportation equipment without operator are 
classified in Subsector 532, Rental and Leasing Services. 
 
481 
 
   Industries in the Air Transportation subsector provide air transportation of passengers and/or cargo using aircraft, 
such as airplanes and helicopters.  The subsector distinguishes scheduled from nonscheduled air transportation.  
Scheduled air carriers fly regular routes on regular schedules and operate even if flights are only partially loaded.  
Nonscheduled carriers often operate during nonpeak time slots at busy airports.  These establishments have more 
flexibility with respect to choice of airport, hours of operation, load factors, and similar operational characteristics.  
Nonscheduled carriers provide chartered air transportation of passengers, cargo, or specialty flying services.  
Specialty flying services establishments use general-purpose aircraft to provide a variety of specialized flying 
services.  
   Scenic and sightseeing air transportation and air courier services are not included in this subsector but are included 
in Subsector 487, Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation and in Subsector 492, Couriers and Messengers.  Although 
these activities may use aircraft, they are different from the activities included in air transportation.  Air sightseeing 
does not usually involve place-to-place transportation; the passenger's flight (e.g., balloon ride, aerial sightseeing) 
typically starts and ends at the same location.  Courier services (individual package or cargo delivery) include more 
than air transportation; road transportation is usually required to deliver the cargo to the intended recipient.

Rail TransportationT 

 
482 
 
   Industries in the Rail Transportation subsector provide rail transportation of passengers and/or cargo using railroad 
rolling stock.  The railroads in this subsector primarily either operate on networks, with physical facilities, labor 
force, and equipment spread over an extensive geographic area, or operate over a short distance on a local rail line. 
   Scenic and sightseeing rail transportation and street railroads, commuter rail, and rapid transit are not included in 
this subsector but are included in Subsector 487, Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation, and Subsector 485, Transit 
and Ground Passenger Transportation, respectively.  Although these activities use railroad rolling stock, they are 
different from the activities included in rail transportation.  Sightseeing and scenic railroads do not usually involve 

place-to-place transportation; the passenger's trip typically starts and ends at the same location.  Commuter railroads 
operate in a manner more consistent with local and urban transit and are often part of integrated transit systems.

   Industries in the Truck Transportation subsector provide over-the-road transportation of cargo using motor 
vehicles, such as trucks and tractor trailers.  The subsector is subdivided into general freight trucking and specialized 
freight trucking.  This distinction reflects differences in equipment used, type of load carried, scheduling, terminal, 
and other networking services.  General freight transportation establishments handle a wide variety of general 
commodities, generally palletized, and transported in a container or van trailer.  Specialized freight transportation is 
the transportation of cargo that, because of size, weight, shape, or other inherent characteristics require specialized 
equipment for transportation. 
   Each of these industry groups is further subdivided based on distance traveled.  Local trucking establishments 
primarily carry goods within a single metropolitan area and its adjacent nonurban areas.  Long distance trucking 
establishments carry goods between metropolitan areas. 
   The Specialized Freight Trucking industry group includes a separate industry for Used Household and Office 
Goods Moving. The household and office goods movers are separated because of the substantial network of 
establishments that has developed to deal with local and long-distance moving and the associated storage.  In this 
area, the same establishment provides both local and long-distance services, while other specialized freight 
establishments generally limit their services to either local or long-distance hauling. 
 
4841  General Freight TruckingT 
 
   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing general freight trucking.  General 
freight establishments handle a wide variety of commodities, generally palletized, and transported in a container or 
van trailer.  The establishments of this industry group provide a combination of the following network activities: 
local pickup, local sorting and terminal operations, line-haul, destination sorting and terminal operations, and local 
delivery.

Transit and Ground Passenger TransportationT 

 
485 
 
   Industries in the Transit and Ground Passenger Transportation subsector include a variety of passenger 
transportation activities, such as urban transit systems; chartered bus, school bus, and interurban bus transportation; 
and taxis.  These activities are distinguished based primarily on such production process factors as vehicle types, 
routes, and schedules. 
   In this subsector, the principal splits identify scheduled transportation as separate from nonscheduled 
transportation.  The scheduled transportation industry groups are Urban Transit Systems, Interurban and Rural Bus 
Transportation, and School and Employee Bus Transportation.  The nonscheduled industry groups are the Charter 
Bus Industry and Taxi and Limousine Service.  The Other Transit and Ground Passenger Transportation industry 
group includes both scheduled and nonscheduled transportation. 
   Scenic and sightseeing ground transportation services are not included in this subsector but are included in

Pipeline TransportationT 

 
486 
 
   Industries in the Pipeline Transportation subsector use transmission pipelines to transport products, such as crude 
oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products, and slurry.  Industries are identified based on the products transported 
(i.e., pipeline transportation of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products, and other products). 
   The Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas industry includes the storage of natural gas because the storage is 
usually done by the pipeline establishment and because a pipeline is inherently a network in which all the nodes are 
interdependent.

Scenic and Sightseeing TransportationT 

 
487 
 
   Industries in the Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation subsector utilize transportation equipment to provide 
recreation and entertainment.  These activities have a production process distinct from passenger transportation 
carried out for the purpose of other types of for-hire transportation.  This process does not emphasize efficient 
transportation; in fact, such activities often use obsolete vehicles, such as steam trains, to provide some extra 
ambience.  The activity is local in nature, usually involving a same-day return to the point of departure. 
   The Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation subsector is separated into three industries based on the mode: land, 
water, and other. 
   Activities that are recreational in nature and involve participation by the customer, such as white-water rafting, are 
generally excluded from this subsector, unless they impose an impact on part of the transportation system.  Charter 
boat fishing, for example, is included in the Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation, Water industry.

Postal ServiceT 

 
491 
 
   The Postal Service subsector includes the activities of the National Post Office and its subcontractors operating 
under a universal service obligation to provide mail services, and using the infrastructure required to fulfill that 
obligation.  These services include delivering letters and small parcels.  These articles can be described as those that 
can be handled by one person without using special equipment.  This allows the collection, pick-up, and delivery 
operations to be done with limited labor costs and minimal equipment.  Sorting and transportation activities, where 
necessary, are generally mechanized.  The restriction to small parcels distinguishes these establishments from those 
in the transportation industries.  These establishments may also provide express delivery services using the 
infrastructure established for provision of basic mail services. 
   The traditional activity of the National Postal Service is described in this subsector.  Subcontractors include rural 
post offices on contract to the Postal Service.  
   Bulk transportation of mail on contract to the Postal Service is not included here, because it is usually done by 
transportation establishments that carry other customers' cargo as well.  Establishments that provide courier and 
express delivery services without operating under a universal service obligation are classified in subsector 492, 
Couriers and Messengers.

   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing mail services under a universal service 
obligation.  Mail services include the carriage of letters, printed matter, or mailable packages, including acceptance, 
collection, processing, and delivery.  Due to the infrastructure requirements of providing mail service under a 

universal service obligation, postal service establishments often provide parcel and express delivery services in 
addition to the mail service.  Establishments primarily engaged in performing one or more parts of the basic mail 
service, such as sorting, routing and/or delivery (except bulk transportation of mail) are included in this industry.

Couriers and MessengersT 

 
492 
 
   Industries in the Couriers and Messengers subsector provide intercity, local, and/or international delivery of 
parcels and documents (including express delivery services) without operating under a universal service obligation.  
These articles may originate in the U.S. but be delivered to another country and can be described as those that may 
be handled by one person without using special equipment.  This allows the collection, pick-up, and delivery 
operations to be done with limited labor costs and minimal equipment.  Sorting and transportation activities, where 
necessary, are generally mechanized.  The restriction to small parcels partly distinguishes these establishments from 
those in the transportation industries.  The complete network of courier services establishments also distinguishes 
these transportation services from local messenger and delivery establishments in this subsector.  This includes the 
establishments that perform intercity transportation as well as establishments that, under contract to them, perform 
local pick-up and delivery.  Messengers, which usually deliver within a metropolitan or single urban area, may use 
bicycle, foot, small truck, or van.

industry form a network that includes local pick-up and delivery to serve their customers' needs.

493  Warehousing and StorageT 
 
   Industries in the Warehousing and Storage subsector are primarily engaged in operating warehousing and storage 
facilities for general merchandise, refrigerated goods, and other warehouse products.  These establishments provide 
facilities to store goods.  They do not sell the goods they handle.  These establishments take responsibility for 
storing the goods and keeping them secure.  They may also provide a range of services, often referred to as logistics 
services, related to the distribution of goods.  Logistics services can include labeling, breaking bulk, inventory 
control and management, light assembly, order entry and fulfillment, packaging, pick and pack, price marking and 
ticketing, and transportation arrangement.  However, establishments in this industry group always provide 
warehousing or storage services in addition to any logistic services.  Furthermore, the warehousing or storage of 
goods must be more than incidental to the performance of services, such as price marking. 
   Bonded warehousing and storage services and warehouses located in free trade zones are included in the industries 
of this subsector.

The Sector as a Whole 

Sector 51—InformationT 

 
   The Information sector comprises establishments engaged in the following processes: (a) producing and 
distributing information and cultural products, (b) providing the means to transmit or distribute these products as 
well as data or communications, and (c) processing data. 
   The main components of this sector are the publishing industries, including software publishing, and both 
traditional publishing and publishing exclusively on the Internet; the motion picture and sound recording industries; 
the broadcasting industries, including traditional broadcasting and those broadcasting exclusively over the Internet; 
the telecommunications industries; Web search portals, data processing industries, and the information services 
industries. 
   The expressions ''information age'' and ''global information economy'' are used with considerable frequency today.  
The general idea of an ''information economy'' includes both the notion of industries primarily producing, 
processing, and distributing information, as well as the idea that every industry is using available information and 
information technology to reorganize and make themselves more productive. 
   For the purposes of NAICS, it is the transformation of information into a commodity that is produced and 
distributed by a number of growing industries that is at issue.  The Information sector groups three types of 
establishments: (1) those engaged in producing and distributing information and cultural products; (2) those that 
provide the means to transmit or distribute these products as well as data or communications; and (3) those that 
process data.  Cultural products are those that directly express attitudes, opinions, ideas, values, and artistic 
creativity; provide entertainment; or offer information and analysis concerning the past and present.  Included in this 
definition are popular, mass-produced products as well as cultural products that normally have a more limited 
audience, such as poetry books, literary magazines, or classical records. 
   The unique characteristics of information and cultural products, and of the processes involved in their production 
and distribution, distinguish the Information sector from the goods-producing and service-producing sectors.  Some 
of these characteristics are: 
 
1. Unlike traditional goods, an ''information or cultural product,'' such as a newspaper on-line or television program, 
does not necessarily have tangible qualities, nor is it necessarily associated with a particular form. A movie can be 
shown at a movie theater, on a television broadcast, through video-on-demand or rented at a local video store. A 
sound recording can be aired on radio, embedded in multimedia products, or sold at a record store. 
 
2. Unlike traditional services, the delivery of these products does not require direct contact between the supplier and 
the consumer. 
 
3. The value of these products to the consumer lies in their informational, educational, cultural, or entertainment 
content, not in the format in which they are distributed.  Most of these products are protected from unlawful 
reproduction by copyright laws.  
 
4. The intangible property aspect of information and cultural products makes the processes involved in their 
production and distribution very different from goods and services.  Only those possessing the rights to these works 
are authorized to reproduce, alter, improve, and distribute them.  Acquiring and using these rights often involves 
significant costs.  In addition, technology is revolutionizing the distribution of these products.  It is possible to 
distribute them in a physical form, via broadcast, or on-line. 
 
5. Distributors of information and cultural products can easily add value to the products they distribute.  For 
instance, broadcasters add advertising not contained in the original product.  This capacity means that unlike 
traditional distributors, they derive revenue not from sale of the distributed product to the final consumer, but from 
those who pay for the privilege of adding information to the original product.  Similarly, a directory and mailing list 
publisher can acquire the rights to thousands of previously published newspaper and periodical articles and add new 
value by providing search and software and organizing the information in a way that facilitates research and 
retrieval.  These products often command a much higher price than the original information. 
 

Publishing Industries (except Internet)T 

  The distribution modes for information commodities may either eliminate the necessity for traditional manufacture, 
or reverse the conventional order of manufacture-distribute:  A newspaper distributed on-line, for example, can be 
printed locally or by the final consumer.  Similarly, it is anticipated that packaged software, which today is mainly 
bought through the traditional retail channels, will soon be available mainly on-line.  The NAICS Information sector 
is designed to make such economic changes transparent as they occur, or to facilitate designing surveys that will 
monitor the new phenomena and provide data to analyze the changes. 
   Many of the industries in the NAICS Information sector are engaged in producing products protected by copyright 
law, or in distributing them (other than distribution by traditional wholesale and retail methods).  Examples are 
traditional publishing industries, software and directory and mailing list publishing industries, and film and sound 
industries.  Broadcasting and telecommunications industries and information providers and processors are also 
included in the Information sector, because their technologies are so closely linked to other industries in the 
Information sector. 
 
511 
 
   Industries in the Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector group establishments engaged in the publishing 
of newspapers, magazines, other periodicals, and books, as well as directory and mailing list and software 
publishing.  In general, these establishments, which are known as publishers, issue copies of works for which they 
usually possess copyright.  Works may be in one or more formats including traditional print form, CD-ROM, or 
proprietary electronic networks.  Publishers may publish works originally created by others for which they have 
obtained the rights and/or works that they have created in-house.  Software publishing is included here because the 
activity, creation of a copyrighted product and bringing it to market, is equivalent to the creation process for other 
types of intellectual products. 
   In NAICS, publishing--the reporting, writing, editing, and other processes that are required to create an edition of 
a newspaper--is treated as a major economic activity in its own right, rather than as a subsidiary activity to a 
manufacturing activity, printing.  Thus, publishing is classified in the Information sector; whereas, printing remains 
in the NAICS Manufacturing sector.  In part, the NAICS classification reflects the fact that publishing increasingly 
takes place in establishments that are physically separate from the associated printing establishments.  More 
crucially, the NAICS classification of book and newspaper publishing is intended to portray their roles in a modern 
economy, in which they do not resemble manufacturing activities. 
   Music publishers are not included in the Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector, but are included in the 
Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries subsector.  Reproduction of prepackaged software is treated in 
NAICS as a manufacturing activity; on-line distribution of software products is in the Information sector, and 
custom design of software to client specifications is included in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services 
sector.  These distinctions arise because of the different ways that software is created, reproduced, and distributed. 
   The Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector does not include establishments that publish exclusively on 
the Internet.  Establishments publishing exclusively on the Internet are included in Subsector 519, Other Information 
Service.  The Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector also excludes products, such as manifold business 
forms.  Information is not the essential component of these items.  Establishments producing these items are 
included in Subsector 323, Printing and Related Support Activities. 
 
5111  Newspaper, Periodical, Book, and Directory PublishersT 
 
   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in publishing newspapers, magazines, other 
periodicals, books, directories and mailing lists, and other works, such as calendars, greeting cards, and maps.  
These works are characterized by the intellectual creativity required in their development and are usually protected 
by copyright.  Publishers distribute or arrange for the distribution of these works. 
   Publishing establishments may create the works in-house, contract for, purchase, or compile works that were 
originally created by others.  These works may be published in one or more formats, such as print and/or electronic 
form, including proprietary electronic networks.  Establishments in this industry may print, reproduce, or offer direct 
access to the works themselves or may arrange with others to carry out such functions. 
   Establishments that both print and publish may fill excess capacity with commercial or job printing.  However, the 
publishing activity is still considered to be the primary activity of these establishments.

512  Motion Picture and Sound Recording IndustriesT 
 
   Industries in the Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries subsector group establishments involved in the 
production and distribution of motion pictures and sound recordings.  While producers and distributors of motion 
pictures and sound recordings issue works for sale as traditional publishers do, the processes are sufficiently 
different to warrant placing establishments engaged in these activities in a separate subsector.  Production is 
typically a complex process that involves several distinct types of establishments that are engaged in activities, such 
as contracting with performers, creating the film or sound content, and providing technical postproduction services.  
Film distribution is often to exhibitors, such as theaters and broadcasters, rather than through the wholesale and 
retail distribution chain.  When the product is in a mass-produced form, NAICS treats production and distribution as 
the major economic activity as it does in the Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector, rather than as a 
subsidiary activity to the manufacture of such products. 
   This subsector does not include establishments primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of videocassettes 
and sound recordings, such as compact discs and audio tapes; these establishments are included in the Wholesale 

Trade sector.  Reproduction of videocassettes and sound recordings that is carried out separately from 
establishments engaged in production and distribution is treated in NAICS as a manufacturing activity.

   Industries in the Telecommunications subsector group establishments that provide telecommunications and the 
services related to that activity (e.g., telephony, including Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP); cable and satellite 
television distribution services; Internet access; telecommunications reselling services).  The Telecommunications 
subsector is primarily engaged in operating, and/or providing access to facilities for the transmission of voice, data, 
text, sound, and video.  Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a combination of 
technologies.  Establishments in the Telecommunications subsector are grouped into four industry groups.  The first 
three are comprised of establishments that operate transmission facilities and infrastructure that they own and/or 
lease, and provide telecommunications services using those facilities.  The distinction among the first three industry 
groups is the type of infrastructure operated (i.e., wired, wireless, or satellite).  The fourth industry group is 
comprised of establishments that provide support activities, telecommunications reselling services, or many of the 
same services provided by establishments in the first three industry groups, but do not operate as 
telecommunications carriers.  Establishments primarily engaged as independent contractors in the installation and 
maintenance of broadcasting and telecommunications systems are classified in Sector 23, Construction.

The Sector as a Whole 

Sector 52--Finance and InsuranceT 

 
   The Finance and Insurance sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in financial transactions 
(transactions involving the creation, liquidation, or change in ownership of financial assets) and/or in facilitating 
financial transactions.  Three principal types of activities are identified: 
 
   1.  Raising funds by taking deposits and/or issuing securities and, in the process, incurring liabilities.  
Establishments engaged in this activity use raised funds to acquire financial assets by making loans and/or 
purchasing securities.  Putting themselves at risk, they channel funds from lenders to borrowers and transform or 
repackage the funds with respect to maturity, scale, and risk.  This activity is known as financial intermediation. 
 
   2.  Pooling of risk by underwriting insurance and annuities.  Establishments engaged in this activity collect fees, 
insurance premiums, or annuity considerations; build up reserves; invest those reserves; and make contractual 
payments.  Fees are based on the expected incidence of the insured risk and the expected return on investment. 
 
   3.  Providing specialized services facilitating or supporting financial intermediation, insurance, and employee 
benefit programs. 
 
   In addition, monetary authorities charged with monetary control are included in this sector. 
   The subsectors, industry groups, and industries within the NAICS Finance and Insurance sector are defined on the 
basis of their unique production processes.  As with all industries, the production processes are distinguished by 
their use of specialized human resources and specialized physical capital.  In addition, the way in which these 
establishments acquire and allocate financial capital, their source of funds, and the use of those funds provides a 
third basis for distinguishing characteristics of the production process.  For instance, the production process in 
raising funds through deposit-taking is different from the process of raising funds in bond or money markets.  The 
process of making loans to individuals also requires different production processes than does the creation of 
investment pools or the underwriting of securities. 
   Most of the Finance and Insurance subsectors contain one or more industry groups of (1) intermediaries with 
similar patterns of raising and using funds and (2) establishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are 
otherwise related to, that type of financial or insurance intermediation.  Industries within this sector are defined in 
terms of activities for which a production process can be specified, and many of these activities are not exclusive to 
a particular type of financial institution.  To deal with the varied activities taking place within existing financial 
institutions, the approach is to split these institutions into components performing specialized services.  This requires 
defining the units engaged in providing those services and developing procedures that allow for their delineation.  
These units are the equivalents for finance and insurance of the establishments defined for other industries. 
   The output of many financial services, as well as the inputs and the processes by which they are combined, cannot 
be observed at a single location and can only be defined at a higher level of the organizational structure of the 
enterprise.  Additionally, a number of independent activities that represent separate and distinct production 
processes may take place at a single location belonging to a multilocation financial firm.  Activities are more likely 
to be homogeneous with respect to production characteristics than are locations, at least in financial services.  The 
classification defines activities broadly enough that it can be used both by those classifying by location and by those 
employing a more top-down approach to the delineation of the establishment. 
   Establishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are otherwise related to, the various types of intermediation 
have been included in individual subsectors, rather than in a separate subsector dedicated to services alone because 
these services are performed by intermediaries, as well as by specialist establishments, the extent to which the 
activity of the intermediaries can be separately identified is not clear. 
   The Finance and Insurance sector has been defined to encompass establishments primarily engaged in financial 
transactions; that is, transactions involving the creation, liquidation, change in ownership of financial assets; or in 
facilitating financial transactions.  Financial industries are extensive users of electronic means for facilitating the 
verification of financial balances, authorizing transactions, transferring funds to and from transactors' accounts, 
notifying banks (or credit card issuers) of the individual transactions, and providing daily summaries.  Since these 
transaction processing activities are integral to the production of finance and insurance services, establishments that 

principally provide a financial transaction processing service are classified to this sector, rather than to the data 
processing industry in the Information sector. 
   Legal entities that hold portfolios of assets on behalf of others are significant and data on them are required for a 
variety of purposes.  Thus for NAICS, these funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles are the fifth subsector of the 
Finance and Insurance sector.  These entities earn interest, dividends, and other property income, but have little or 
no employment and no revenue from the sale of services.  Separate establishments and employees devoted to the 
management of funds are classified in Industry Group 5239, Other Financial Investment Activities. 
 
521  Monetary Authorities-Central BankT 
 
   The Monetary Authorities-Central Bank subsector groups establishments that engage in performing central 
banking functions, such as issuing currency, managing the Nation's money supply and international reserves, 
holding deposits that represent the reserves of other banks and other central banks, and acting as a fiscal agent for 
the central government.

Sector 53--Real Estate and Rental and LeasingT 

 

The Sector as a Whole 

 
   The Real Estate and Rental and Leasing sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in renting, leasing, or 
otherwise allowing the use of tangible or intangible assets, and establishments providing related services.  The major 
portion of this sector comprises establishments that rent, lease, or otherwise allow the use of their own assets by 
others.  The assets may be tangible, as is the case of real estate and equipment, or intangible, as is the case with 
patents and trademarks. 
   This sector also includes establishments primarily engaged in managing real estate for others, selling, renting 
and/or buying real estate for others, and appraising real estate.  These activities are closely related to this sector's 
main activity, and it was felt that from a production basis they would best be included here.  In addition, a 
substantial proportion of property management is self-performed by lessors. 
   The main components of this sector are the real estate lessors industries (including equity real estate investment 
trusts (REITs)); equipment lessors industries (including motor vehicles, computers, and consumer goods); and 
lessors of nonfinancial intangible assets (except copyrighted works). 
   Excluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in renting or leasing equipment with operators.  
Establishments renting or leasing equipment with operators are classified in various subsectors of NAICS depending 
on the nature of the services provided (e.g., transportation, construction, agriculture).  These activities are excluded 
from this sector because the client is paying for the expertise and knowledge of the equipment operator, in addition 
to the rental of the equipment.  In many cases, such as the rental of heavy construction equipment, the operator is 
essential to operate the equipment. 
 
531 
 
   Industries in the Real Estate subsector group establishments that are primarily engaged in renting or leasing real 
estate to others; managing real estate for others; selling, buying, or renting real estate for others; and providing other 
real estate related services, such as appraisal services. 
   This subsector includes equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) that are primarily engaged in leasing 
buildings, dwellings, or other real estate property to others.  Mortgage REITs are classified in Subsector 525, Funds, 
Trusts, and Other Financial Vehicles. 
   Establishments primarily engaged in subdividing and developing unimproved real estate and constructing 
buildings for sale are classified in Subsector 236, Construction of Buildings.  Establishments primarily engaged in 
subdividing and improving raw land for subsequent sale to builders are classified in Subsector 237, Heavy and Civil

Rental and Leasing ServicesT 

 
532 
 
   Industries in the Rental and Leasing Services subsector include establishments that provide a wide array of 
tangible goods, such as automobiles, computers, consumer goods, and industrial machinery and equipment, to 
customers in return for a periodic rental or lease payment. 
   The subsector includes two main types of establishments:  (1) those that are engaged in renting consumer goods 
and equipment and (2) those that are engaged in leasing machinery and equipment often used for business 
operations.  The first type typically operates from a retail-like or store-front facility and maintains inventories of 
goods that are rented for short periods of time.  The latter type typically does not operate from retail-like locations or 
maintain inventories, and offers longer term leases.  These establishments work directly with clients to enable them 

to acquire the use of equipment on a lease basis, or they work with equipment vendors or dealers to support the 
marketing of equipment to their customers under lease arrangements.  Equipment lessors generally structure lease 
contracts to meet the specialized needs of their clients and use their remarketing expertise to find other users for 
previously leased equipment.  Establishments that provide operating and capital (i.e., finance) leases are included in 
this subsector. 
   Establishments primarily engaged in leasing in combination with providing loans are classified in Sector 52, 
Finance and Insurance.  Establishments primarily engaged in leasing real property are classified in Subsector 531, 
Real Estate.  Those establishments primarily engaged in renting or leasing equipment with operators are classified in 
various subsectors of NAICS depending on the nature of the services provided (e.g., Transportation, Construction, 
Agriculture).  These activities are excluded from this subsector since the client is paying for the expertise and 
knowledge of the equipment operator, in addition to the rental of the equipment.  In many cases, such as the rental of 
heavy construction equipment, the operator is essential to operate the equipment.  Likewise, since the provision of 
crop harvesting services includes both the equipment and operator, it is included in the agriculture subsector.  The 
rental or leasing of copyrighted works is classified in Sector 51, Information, and the rental or leasing of assets, such 
as patents, trademarks, and/or licensing agreements is classified in Subsector 533, Lessors of Nonfinancial 
Intangible Assets (except Copyrighted Works). 
 
5321  Automotive Equipment Rental and LeasingT 
 
   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in renting or leasing the following types of 
vehicles:  passenger cars and trucks without drivers, and utility trailers.  These establishments generally operate 
from a retail-like facility.  Some establishments offer only short-term rental, others only longer-term leases, and 
some provide both types of services.

Sector 54--Professional, Scientific, and Technical ServicesT 

 

The Sector as a Whole 

Professional, Scientific, and Technical ServicesT 

 
   The Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services sector comprises establishments that specialize in performing 
professional, scientific, and technical activities for others.  These activities require a high degree of expertise and 
training.  The establishments in this sector specialize according to expertise and provide these services to clients in a 
variety of industries and, in some cases, to households.  Activities performed include: legal advice and 
representation; accounting, bookkeeping, and payroll services; architectural, engineering, and specialized design 
services; computer services; consulting services; research services; advertising services; photographic services; 
translation and interpretation services; veterinary services; and other professional, scientific, and technical services. 
   This sector excludes establishments primarily engaged in providing a range of day-to-day office administrative 
services, such as financial planning, billing and recordkeeping, personnel, and physical distribution and logistics.  
These establishments are classified in Sector 56, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and 
Remediation Services. 
 
541 
 
   Industries in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services subsector group establishments engaged in 
processes where human capital is the major input.  These establishments make available the knowledge and skills of 
their employees, often on an assignment basis, where an individual or team is responsible for the delivery of services 
to the client.  The individual industries of this subsector are defined on the basis of the particular expertise and 
training of the services provider. 
   The distinguishing feature of the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services subsector is the fact that most of 
the industries grouped in it have production processes that are almost wholly dependent on worker skills.  In most of 
these industries, equipment and materials are not of major importance, unlike health care, for example, where "high 
tech" machines and materials are important collaborating inputs to labor skills in the production of health care.  
Thus, the establishments classified in this subsector sell expertise.  Much of the expertise requires degrees, though 
not in every case.

   Establishments in this sector perform essential activities that are often undertaken in-house by establishments in 
many sectors of the economy.  By consolidating the performance of these activities of the enterprise at one 
establishment, economies of scale are achieved. 
   Government establishments primarily engaged in administering, overseeing, and managing governmental 
programs are classified in Sector 92, Public Administration.  Establishments primarily engaged in providing a range

Sector 56--Administrative and Support and Waste Management and 

Remediation ServicesT 

 

The Sector as a Whole 

Administrative and Support ServicesT 

 
   The Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services sector comprises 
establishments performing routine support activities for the day-to-day operations of other organizations.  These 
essential activities are often undertaken in-house by establishments in many sectors of the economy.  The 
establishments in this sector specialize in one or more of these support activities and provide these services to clients 
in a variety of industries and, in some cases, to households.  Activities performed include: office administration, 
hiring and placing of personnel, document preparation and similar clerical services, solicitation, collection, security 
and surveillance services, cleaning, and waste disposal services. 
   The administrative and management activities performed by establishments in this sector are typically on a 
contract or fee basis.  These activities may also be performed by establishments that are part of the company or 
enterprise.  However, establishments involved in administering, overseeing, and managing other establishments of 
the company or enterprise are classified in Sector 55, Management of Companies and Enterprises.  Establishments 
in Sector 55, Management of Companies and Enterprises normally undertake the strategic and organizational 
planning and decision making role of the company or enterprise.  Government establishments engaged in 
administering, overseeing, and managing governmental programs are classified in Sector 92, Public Administration. 
 
561 
 
   Industries in the Administrative and Support Services subsector group establishments engaged in activities that 
support the day-to-day operations of other organizations.  The processes employed in this sector (e.g., general 
management, personnel administration, clerical activities, cleaning activities) are often integral parts of the activities 
of establishments found in all sectors of the economy.  The establishments classified in this subsector have 
specialization in one or more of these activities and can, therefore, provide services to clients in a variety of 
industries and, in some cases, to households.  The individual industries of this subsector are defined on the basis of 
the particular process that they are engaged in and the particular services they provide. 
   Many of the activities performed in this subsector are ongoing routine support functions that all businesses and 
organizations must do and that they have traditionally done for themselves.  Recent trends, however, are to contract 
or purchase such services from businesses that specialize in such activities and can, therefore, provide the services 
more efficiently. 
   The industries in this subsector cannot be viewed as strictly "support." The Travel Arrangement and Reservation 
Services industry group includes travel agents, tour operators, and providers of other travel arrangement services, 
such as hotel and restaurant reservations and arranging the purchase of tickets, serving many types of clients, 
including individual consumers.  This group was placed in this subsector because the services are often of the 
"support" nature (e.g., travel arrangement) and businesses and other organizations are increasingly the ones 
purchasing such services. 
   The administrative and management activities performed by establishments in this sector are typically on a 
contract or fee basis.  These activities may also be performed by establishments that are part of the company or 
enterprise.  However, establishments involved in administering, overseeing, and managing other establishments of 
the company or enterprise are classified in Sector 55, Management of Companies and Enterprises.  Establishments 
in Sector 55 normally undertake the strategic and organizational planning and decision making role of the company 
or enterprise.  Government establishments engaged in administering, overseeing, and managing governmental 
programs are classified in Sector 92, Public Administration.

   The Educational Services sector comprises establishments that provide instruction and training in a wide variety of 
subjects.  This instruction and training is provided by specialized establishments, such as schools, colleges, 
universities, and training centers.  These establishments may be privately owned and operated for profit or not for 
profit, or they may be publicly owned and operated.  They may also offer food and/or accommodation services to 
their students. 
   Educational services are usually delivered by teachers or instructors that explain, tell, demonstrate, supervise, and 
direct learning.  Instruction is imparted in diverse settings, such as educational institutions, the workplace, or the 
home, and through diverse means, such as correspondence, television, the Internet, or other electronic and distance-
learning methods.  The training provided by these establishments may include the use of simulators and simulation 
methods.  It can be adapted to the particular needs of the students, for example sign language can replace verbal 
language for teaching students with hearing impairments.  All industries in the sector share this commonality of 
process, namely, labor inputs of instructors with the requisite subject matter expertise and teaching ability.

   Industries in the Educational Services subsector provide instruction and training in a wide variety of subjects.  The 
instruction and training is provided by specialized establishments, such as schools, colleges, universities, and 
training centers. 
   The subsector is structured according to level and type of educational services.  Elementary and secondary 
schools, junior colleges and colleges, universities, and professional schools correspond to a recognized series of 
formal levels of education designated by diplomas, associate degrees (including equivalent certificates), and 
degrees.  The remaining industry groups are based more on the type of instruction or training offered and the levels 
are not always as formally defined.  The establishments are often highly specialized, many offering instruction in a 
very limited subject matter, for example ski lessons or one specific computer software package.  Within the sector, 
the level and types of training that are required of the instructors and teachers vary depending on the industry. 
   Establishments that manage schools and other educational establishments on a contractual basis are classified in 
this subsector if they both manage the operation and provide the operating staff.  Such establishments are classified 
in the Educational Services subsector based on the type of facility managed and operated.

Sector 62--Health Care and Social AssistanceT 

The Sector as a Whole 

 

 

Ambulatory Health Care ServicesT 

   The Health Care and Social Assistance sector comprises establishments providing health care and social assistance 
for individuals.  The sector includes both health care and social assistance because it is sometimes difficult to 
distinguish between the boundaries of these two activities.  The industries in this sector are arranged on a continuum 
starting with those establishments providing medical care exclusively, continuing with those providing health care 
and social assistance, and finally finishing with those providing only social assistance.  The services provided by 
establishments in this sector are delivered by trained professionals.  All industries in the sector share this 
commonality of process, namely, labor inputs of health practitioners or social workers with the requisite expertise.  
Many of the industries in the sector are defined based on the educational degree held by the practitioners included in 
the industry.  
   Excluded from this sector are aerobic classes in Subsector 713, Amusement, Gambling, and Recreation Industries 
and nonmedical diet and weight reducing centers in Subsector 812, Personal and Laundry Services.  Although these 
can be viewed as health services, these services are not typically delivered by health practitioners.

   Industries in the Ambulatory Health Care Services subsector provide health care services directly or indirectly to 
ambulatory patients and do not usually provide inpatient services.  Health practitioners in this subsector provide

Sector 71--Arts, Entertainment, and RecreationT 

 

The Sector as a Whole 

Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related IndustriesT 

 
   The Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation sector includes a wide range of establishments that operate facilities or 
provide services to meet varied cultural, entertainment, and recreational interests of their patrons.  This sector 
comprises (1) establishments that are involved in producing, promoting, or participating in live performances, 
events, or exhibits intended for public viewing; (2) establishments that preserve and exhibit objects and sites of 
historical, cultural, or educational interest; and (3) establishments that operate facilities or provide services that 
enable patrons to participate in recreational activities or pursue amusement, hobby, and leisure-time interests. 
   Some establishments that provide cultural, entertainment, or recreational facilities and services are classified in 
other sectors.  Excluded from this sector are: (1) establishments that provide both accommodations and recreational 
facilities, such as hunting and fishing camps and resort and casino hotels are classified in Subsector 721, 
Accommodation; (2) restaurants and night clubs that provide live entertainment in addition to the sale of food and 
beverages are classified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places; (3) motion picture theaters, libraries 
and archives, and publishers of newspapers, magazines, books, periodicals, and computer software are classified in 
Sector 51, Information; and (4) establishments using transportation equipment to provide recreational and 
entertainment services, such as those operating sightseeing buses, dinner cruises, or helicopter rides, are classified in 
Subsector 487, Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation. 
 
711 
 
   Industries in the Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector group establishments that 
produce or organize and promote live presentations involving the performances of actors and actresses, singers, 
dancers, musical groups and artists, athletes, and other entertainers, including independent (i.e., freelance) 
entertainers and the establishments that manage their careers.  The classification recognizes four basic processes: (1) 
producing (i.e., presenting) events; (2) organizing, managing, and/or promoting events; (3) managing and 
representing entertainers; and (4) providing the artistic, creative and technical skills necessary to the production of 
these live events.  Also, this subsector contains four industries for performing arts companies.  Each is defined on 
the basis of the particular skills of the entertainers involved in the presentations. 
   The industry structure for this subsector makes a clear distinction between performing arts companies and 
performing artists (i.e., independent or freelance).  Although not unique to arts and entertainment, freelancing is a 
particularly important phenomenon in this Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector.  
Distinguishing this activity from the production activity is a meaningful process differentiation.  This approach, 
however, is difficult to implement in the case of musical groups (i.e., companies) and artists, especially pop groups.  
These establishments tend to be more loosely organized and it can be difficult to distinguish companies from 
freelancers.  For this reason, NAICS includes one industry that covers both musical groups and musical artists. 
   This subsector contains two industries for Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar 
Events, one for those that operate facilities and another for those that do not.  This is because there are significant 
differences in cost structures between those promoters that manage and provide the staff to operate facilities and 
those that do not.  In addition to promoters without facilities, other industries in this subsector include 
establishments that may operate without permanent facilities.  These types of establishments include: performing 
arts companies; musical groups and artists; spectator sports; and independent (i.e., freelance) artists, writers, and 
performers. 
   Excluded from this subsector are nightclubs.  Some nightclubs promote live entertainment on a regular basis and it 
can be argued that they could be classified in Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and 
Similar Events.  However, since most of these establishments function as any other drinking place when they do not 
promote entertainment and because most of their revenue is derived from sale of food and beverages, they are 
classified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places.

performances of actors and actresses, singers, dancers, musical groups and artists, and other performing artists.

   Industries in the Amusement, Gambling, and Recreation Industries subsector (1) operate facilities where patrons 
can primarily engage in sports, recreation, amusement, or gambling activities and/or (2) provide other amusement 
and recreation services, such as supplying and servicing amusement devices in places of business operated by 
others; operating sports teams, clubs, or leagues engaged in playing games for recreational purposes; and guiding 
tours without using transportation equipment. 
   This subsector does not cover all establishments providing recreational services. Other sectors of NAICS also 
provide recreational services. Providers of recreational services are often engaged in processes classified in other 
sectors of NAICS.  For example, operators of resorts and hunting and fishing camps provide both accommodation 
and recreational facilities and services.  These establishments are classified in Subsector 721, Accommodation, 
partly to reflect the significant costs associated with the provision of accommodation services and partly to ensure 
consistency with international standards.  Likewise, establishments using transportation equipment to provide 
recreational and entertainment services, such as those operating sightseeing buses, dinner cruises, or helicopter rides, 
are classified in Sector 48-49, Transportation and Warehousing.

gambling industries, and other amusement and recreation industries.  The groups, however, are not all inclusive of 
the activity.  The Gambling Industries industry group does not provide for full coverage of gambling activities.  For

The Sector as a Whole 

AccommodationT 

 
   The Accommodation and Food Services sector comprises establishments providing customers with lodging and/or 
preparing meals, snacks, and beverages for immediate consumption.  The sector includes both accommodation and 
food services establishments because the two activities are often combined at the same establishment. 
   Excluded from this sector are civic and social organizations; amusement and recreation parks; theaters; and other 
recreation or entertainment facilities providing food and beverage services. 
 
721 
 
   Industries in the Accommodation subsector provide lodging or short-term accommodations for travelers, 
vacationers, and others.  There is a wide range of establishments in these industries.  Some provide lodging only; 
while others provide meals, laundry services, and recreational facilities, as well as lodging.  Lodging establishments 
are classified in this subsector even if the provision of complementary services generates more revenue.  The types 
of complementary services provided vary from establishment to establishment. 
   The subsector is organized into three groups: (1) traveler accommodation, (2) recreational accommodation, and (3) 
rooming and boarding houses.  The Traveler Accommodation industry group includes establishments that primarily 
provide traditional types of lodging services.  This group includes hotels, motels, and bed-and-breakfast inns.  In 
addition to lodging, these establishments may provide a range of other services to their guests.  The RV 
(Recreational Vehicle) Parks and Recreational Camps industry group includes establishments that operate lodging 
facilities primarily designed to accommodate outdoor enthusiasts.  Included are travel trailer campsites, recreational 
vehicle parks, and outdoor adventure retreats.  The Rooming and Boarding Houses industry group includes 
establishments providing temporary or longer-term accommodations, that for the period of occupancy, may serve as 
a principal residence. Board (i.e., meals) may be provided but is not essential. 
   Establishments that manage short-stay accommodation establishments (e.g., hotels and motels) on a contractual 
basis are classified in this subsector if they both manage the operation and provide the operating staff.  Such 
establishments are classified based on the type of facility managed and operated.

Sector 81--Other Services (except Public Administration)T 

 

The Sector as a Whole 

Repair and MaintenanceT 

 
   The Other Services (except Public Administration) sector comprises establishments engaged in providing services 
not specifically provided for elsewhere in the classification system.  Establishments in this sector are primarily 
engaged in activities such as equipment and machinery repairing, promoting or administering religious activities, 
grantmaking, advocacy, and providing drycleaning and laundry services, personal care services, death care services, 
pet care services, photofinishing services, temporary parking services, and dating services. 
   Private households that engage in employing workers on or about the premises in activities primarily concerned 
with the operation of the household are included in this sector. 
   Excluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in retailing new equipment and also performing 
repairs and general maintenance on equipment.  These establishments are classified in Sector 44-45, Retail Trade. 
 
811 
 
   Industries in the Repair and Maintenance subsector restore machinery, equipment, and other products to working 
order.  These establishments also typically provide general or routine maintenance (i.e., servicing) on such products 
to ensure they work efficiently and to prevent breakdown and unnecessary repairs. 
   The NAICS structure for this subsector brings together most types of repair and maintenance establishments and 
categorizes them based on production processes (i.e., on the type of repair and maintenance activity performed, and 
the necessary skills, expertise, and processes that are found in different repair and maintenance establishments).  
This NAICS classification does not delineate between repair services provided to businesses versus those that serve 
households.  Although some industries primarily serve either businesses or households, separation by class of 
customer is limited by the fact that many establishments serve both.  Establishments repairing computers and 
consumer electronics products are two examples of such overlap. 
   The Repair and Maintenance subsector does not include all establishments that do repair and maintenance.  For 
example, a substantial amount of repair is done by establishments that also manufacture machinery, equipment, and 
other goods.  These establishments are included in the Manufacturing sector in NAICS.  In addition, repair of 
transportation equipment is often provided by or based at transportation facilities, such as airports and seaports, and 
these activities are included in the Transportation and Warehousing sector.  A particularly unique situation exists 
with repair of buildings.  Plumbing, electrical installation and repair, painting and decorating, and other 
construction-related establishments are often involved in performing installation or other work on new construction 
as well as providing repair services on existing structures.  While some specialize in repair, it is difficult to 
distinguish between the two types and all have been included in the Construction sector. 
   Excluded from this subsector are establishments primarily engaged in rebuilding or remanufacturing machinery 
and equipment.  These are classified in Sector 31-33, Manufacturing.  Also excluded are retail establishments that 
provide after-sale services and repair.  These are classified in Sector 44-45, Retail Trade.

Sector 92--Public AdministrationT 

 

The Sector as a Whole 

 
   The Public Administration sector consists of establishments of federal, state, and local government agencies that 
administer, oversee, and manage public programs and have executive, legislative, or judicial authority over other 
institutions within a given area.  These agencies also set policy, create laws, adjudicate civil and criminal legal 
cases, provide for public safety and for national defense.  In general, government establishments in the Public 
Administration sector oversee governmental programs and activities that are not performed by private 
establishments.  Establishments in this sector typically are engaged in the organization and financing of the 
production of public goods and services, most of which are provided for free or at prices that are not economically 
significant. 
   Government establishments also engage in a wide range of productive activities covering not only public goods 
and services but also individual goods and services similar to those produced in sectors typically identified with 
private-sector establishments.  In general, ownership is not a criterion for classification in NAICS.  Therefore, 
government establishments engaged in the production of private-sector-like goods and services should be classified 
in the same industry as private-sector establishments engaged in similar activities. 
   As a practical matter, it is difficult to identify separate establishment detail for many government agencies.  To the 
extent that separate establishment records are available, the administration of governmental programs is classified in 
Sector 92, Public Administration, while the operation of that same governmental program is classified elsewhere in 
NAICS based on the activities performed.  For example, the governmental administrative authority for an airport is 
classified in Industry 92612, Regulation and Administration of Transportation Programs, while operating the airport 
is classified in Industry 48811, Airport Operations.  When separate records for multi-establishment companies are 
not available to distinguish between the administration of a governmental program and the operation of it, the 
establishment is classified in Sector 92, Public Administration. 
   Examples of government-provided goods and services that are classified in sectors other than Public 
Administration include: schools, classified in Sector 61, Educational Services; hospitals, classified in Subsector 622, 
Hospitals; establishments operating transportation facilities, classified in Sector 48-49, Transportation and 
Warehousing; the operation of utilities, classified in Sector 22, Utilities; and the Government Printing Office, 
classified in Subsector 323, Printing and Related Support Activities.
