2 Relevant Statutory Authority
This exemption application is expressly submitted to fulfill Congress' goal in passing Section 333(a)
through (c) of the P.L. 112-95, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act ('Reform Act'). This law
directs the Secretary of Transportation to consider whether certain unmanned aircraft systems may
3
operate safely in the national airspace system (NAS) before completion of the rulemaking required
under Section 332 of the Reform Act. In making this determination, the Secretary is required to
determine which types of UASs do not create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public or pose a
threat to national security in light of the following:
• The UAS's size, weight, speed, and operational capability;
• Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and
• Operation of the UAS within visual line of sight of the operator.1
Lastly, if the Secretary determines that such vehicles "may operate safely in the national airspace
system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft in the
national airspace system."2
The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to issue exemptions. This
statutory authority by its terms includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under
§40101 of the Act, that includes sUASs, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must have a
current airworthiness certificate
3 Qualification for Approval Under Section 333 of the Reform Act
The proposed operations in this petition for exemption qualify for expedited approval under Sec·
tion 333 of the Reform Act. Each of the statutory criteria and other potentially relevant factors are
satisfied. The requested exemption would permit Ravens to perform commercial operations under
controlled conditions in airspace that is 1) limited 2) predetermined 3) restricted, limited, or controlled
as to access and 4) would provide safety enhancements to the already safe operations in these
industries presently using conventional aircraft. Approval of this exemption would thereby enhance
safety and fulfill the Secretary of Transportation's (the FAA Administrator's) responsibilities to
"estabhsh requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system."
Section 333(c) of the Reform Act.
Each Ravens sUAS weighs 55 lb. or less including payload. Each Ravens sUAS operates under
normal conditions at a speed of no more than 87 knots. Each Ravens sUAS has the capability to
operate in either Automatic' or Manual' mode as described in the Ravens Manual.
Generally Ravens s UAS operations will be below an altitude of 400ft. AGL, within specific accessrestricted
areas, either within Class G airspace or with the permission of the ATC, using s UAS
operated by Ravens·qualified s UAS pilots, and within the visual line of sight of the operator and
observer. Such operations will insure that the sUAS will "not create a hazard to users of the National
Airspace System or the public" as per the FMRA 2012 Section 333. Given the size of the sUAS and
the operating environment, this petition for exemption meets an equivalent level of safety, in which
Congress envisioned that the FAA must, by exemption allow commercial operations of UASs to
commence innnediately. Also due to the size and enviromnent, approval of the application presents no
national security issue.
1Public Law 112-95, 'FAA Modernization and Reform Act' Section 333 (a)
2!d. §333(c).
4
Considering the clear direction in Section 333 of the Reform Act, the authority contained in the
Federal Aviation Act, as amended, the equivalent level of safety surrounding the proposed operations,
and the significant public benefit described herein, the grant of the requested exemptions is
also in the public interest.
4 Ravens Description of Proposed Operations
Ravens operations will provide a level of safety that is equivalent to current aviation standards.
Ravens safety procedures, risk assessments, and flight operations standards are described in detail in
the accompanying Ravens Manual. In brief, the following procedures that apply during operations
conducted under this exemption request, establish an equivalent level of safety (ELOS) as follows:
1. The s UAS will weigh less than 55 lb.
2. Flights will be operated within line of sight of a pilot and/or observer.
3. Flights will occur during daylight hours.
4. Flights will occur during Visual Flight Rules Meteorological Conditions (VMC).
5. Flights will generally be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feetAGL and within Class
G airspace. Operations in controlled B,C, or D airspace will be conducted in coordination with
the proper FSDO and ATC with prior permission.
6. Flights will be terminated at 25% battery power reserve should that occur during the operation.
7. All Ravens s UAS will be U.S. registered and display marks either in accordance with 14 C.F.R.
Part 45, Subpart C or approved alternative markings.
8. Operations will be conducted in defined regions and over property authorized for this use by the
landowner. All operations will remain within the geographic boundaries of the operating area.
Most operations may be conducted within the limitations of the blanket COA authorization
provided with 333 grants as of 3/23/2015.
9. All required permissions and permits will be obtained from territorial, state, county or city
jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental agencies.
10. The operator will obtain the permission of the site owner prior to conducting operations.
Ravens staff or team members will be notified prior to the operation. Non-participants including
spectators will be notified prior to any actual flight operations. Ravens sUAS will
remain a safe distance away from nonparticipants including spectators. Specific separation
requirements will be stated in the Ravens sUAS Operating Manual.
11. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned sUAS operations prior to each day's
activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties within the
boundaries of the safety perimeter be present for this briefing.
12. Minimum crew for each operation will consist of the sUAS Pilot, the Visual Observer, and/or
the Camera Operator.
5
13. Operations without a Visual Observer (sUAS Pilot only) may occasionally be conducted subject
to additional and specifi aircraft equipment, operator competency, and flight restrictions
(maximum distance from the sUAS Pilot, maximum altitude, and maximum speed) as defined in
the Ravens s UAS Operations Manual.
14. sUAS operations under this exemption will be conducted under the supervision of a designated
pilot in command (PI C) who has final responsibility for the operation and in accordance with 14
C.F.R. 91.3. All sUAS operators must have completed training on the normal, abnormal, and
emergency procedures in the Ravens Manual and demonstrated proficiency with the sUAS being
operated. The PIC will meet at least the minimum FAA sUAS regulations for licensure.
Currently, therefore, Ravens PICs must possess at least a sport pilot certificate and hold a
valid U.S. driver's license, unless alternative proposed in Ravens manual is approved by the
FAA.
15. s UAS Pilot will be Pilot in Command (PIC). If a pilot certificate holder other than the
s UAS Pilot, who possess the necessary PIC qualifications, is also present (i.e. the Visual
Observer), that person can also be designated as the PIC.
16. Observer and pilot will at all times be able to maintain verbal communication, either directly or
through electronic means.
17. Operators and engineers will maintain the sUAS system in a condition for safe operation ac·
cording to the Ravens Manual and associated manufacturer's maintenance manuals, including
pre-flight and post-flight inspections.
18. The PIC and observers will maintain situational awareness and perceive, process, and perform
risk management prior to and during each operation as described in the Ravens Manual. The
PIC will terminate the operation in accordance with the Ravens Manual if hazards that cannot
be acceptably mitigated are observed.
19. sUAS will safely stop operating and either return home or auto-land at a safe location along
the flight path if the control link is lost.
20. For each sUAS, the PIC will have the ability to force a controlled landing at any time.
In addition to the above, the Ravens have implemented a Safety Management System. The Ravens
Safety Manager is responsible for conducting safety audits, investigations, and inspections and is
authorized to stop or prohibit any activity or operations which is considered unsafe. Full details
are available in the Ravens Manual.
5 Regulations From Which Exemption is Requested
5.1 Part 61, Certification: Pilots, Flight Instructors, and Ground Instructors
Extent of Relief
Part 61, all sections.
6
Reason for Relief
Because the UAS will not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operations can achieve the
equivalent level of safety of current operations by requiring the PIC operating the aircraft to have at
least a sport pilot's license rather than a commercial pilot's license to operate these sUAS.
Equivalent Level of Safety
Unlike a conventional aircraft that carries the pilot and passengers, the sUAS is remotely controlled
with no living thing on board. The area of operation is controlled and restricted, and all flights
are planned and coordinated in advance as set forth in the General Operations Manual (GOM).
The level of safety provided by the requirements included in the GOM exceeds that provided by a
single individual holding a commercial pilot's certificate operating a conventional aircraft. The
risks associated with the operation of the sUAS are so diminished from the level ofrisk associated
with commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 when drafted, that allowing operations of
the sUAS as requested with a sport pilot certificate as the PIC exceeds the present level of
safety achieved by 14 C.F.R. §61.113 (a) & (b).
5.2 61.113 Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command.
Extent of Relief
Relief from requirement to possess a private or commercial pilot's license for aerial work such as
aerial survey and mapping.
Reason for Relief
§61.113 (a) stipulates that a holder of a private pilot certificate may not act as a pilot in command
of an aircraft for compensation or hire: (b) states that a private pilot may act as PIC if the flight is
incidental to business and does not carry passengers or property. Furthermore, N-8900.227 "Unmanned
Aircraft Systems (UAS) Operational Approval'' paragraph 16(c)(2)(c) "Operations without a
pilot certificate" states that a operations which conform to said paragraph may be performed by a
PIC that does not possess a private pilots license but that has completed FAA private pilot ground
instruction and passed the FAA Private Pilot written test. In addition, there is no means currently of
obtaining a commercial rating for UAS. Thus, we require relief in order to perform aerial work.
Public Benefit
As described above, the public benefit includes exponential economic growth, enhanced safety, and
improved precision agriculture capabilities. In general, commercial small UAS operations provide
aerial services which are affordable to small businesses, something that would not be possible without
UAS technology.
Equivalent Level of Safety
Our operations fulfill all the requirements in N-8900.227 16(c)(2)(c) for operations without a private
pilots license.
7
5.3 91.7 Civil aircraft airworthiness.
Extent of Relief
91. 7, all provisions.
Reason for Relief
Should the exemption be granted allowing commercial operation of the s UAS without an airwor
thiness certificate no standard will exist for airworthiness ofthe sUAS.
Equivalent Level of Safety
Given the size and weight of these aircraft and the requirements contained in the GOM, an equivalent
level of safety will be achieved by insuring compliance with the sUAS user manuals prior to each
flight.
5.4 91.119, Minimum safe altitudes: General.
Extent of Relief
Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. 91.119(c) limits aircraft flying over
areas other than congested areas to an altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or
sparsely populated areas, and the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person,
vessel, vehicle, or structure.
Reason for Relief
To provide for these operations, the s UAS are normally operated at or below 400 feet AGL. In
addition, due to the nature of the proposed operations, the PIC and the observer may at times be
less than 500 feet away from structures during the operation.
Equivalent Level of Safety
The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, and speed of the UAS as well
as the location where it is operated. No flight will be taken without the required permission of the
property owner and local officials, and advanced notice to participants and spectators. Because of the
advance notice all affected individuals will be aware of the planned flight. Compared to flight
operations with aircraft or rotorcraft weighing far more than the maximum 55lbs. described above
and the lack of flammable fuel, any risk associated with these operations is far less than those
presently conducted with conventional aircraft operating at or below 500 AGL in other industries. In
addition, the low· altitude operations of the s UAS will ensure separation between these s UAS
operations and the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with Section 91.119.
5.5 91.121 Altimeter Settings
Extent of Relief
§91.121
8
Reason for Relief
As the sUAS may not have a barometric altimeter, but instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemp·
tion may be needed.
Equivalent Level of Safety
An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by the operator, pursuant to the GOM and the Safety
Check list, confirming the altitude of the launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before
flight.
5.6 91.151, Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions.
Extent of Relief
§91.151, all provisions.
Reason for Relief
The provision requires fuel sufficient for one half hour flight beyond the destination. These sUAS,
including today's longest endurance platforms, are unable to meet this requirement because of limited
max flight times.
Equivalent Level of Safety
An equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights for the s UAS according to the safety
limitations described in the GOM. This restriction would be more than adequate to return the
s UAS to its planned landing zone from anywhere in its limited operating area.
5.7 91.405, 91.407, 91.409, 91.417 Inspection and Maintenance Programs
Extent of Relief
§§91.405, Maintenance required; 91.407, Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,
or alteration; 91.409, Inspections; and 91.417, Maintenance records.
Reason for Relief
The part 91 provisions are not applicable to a s UAS of the described weight class. Furthermore,
FAA certified mechanics for s UAS do not at this present time exist, so full compliance is not possible.
The s UAS flown are modular and as such entire components including engines and propellers are
minor replacements rather than major repairs. Finally, continuous minor alterations and payload
reconfigurations of sUAS are designed and required for the operation of sUAS and do not negatively
impact airworthiness.
9
Equivalent Level of Safety
Inspection and maintenance manuals are used to maintain the sUAS in airworthy condition. Each
s UAS is maintained according to the manufacturer standard or higher by technicians proficient in
the building, repair, and maintenance of the sUAS. Inspection and Maintenance manuals utilized
contain all aircraft-relevant items as described in (43 Appendix D (Scope and Detail of Items).
Finally, maintenance records are maintained in the Operations Database; either online on the
Skyward Platform and are therefore immediately auditable by regulators on demand, or as otherwise
determined by Ravens.
6 Public Interest
The Ravens believe that the enhanced safety achieved using a sUAS with the specifications described in
this petition and supporting documents and by carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a
manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel,
gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operations enabled by this exemption are in the
public interest.
The outputs of safe, reliable, and regulatory compliant operations of sUAS provide economic benefits
historically unparalleled since the invention of flight, benefiting stakeholders at every level, both
public and private. Lawful, safe aerial robotics operations will create new high-tech employment
that will stimulate city and state governments; improve industries, create new small and large
businesses; infuse new interest in STEM for children; and increase the safety of citizens through
enhanced first-responder capabilities.
7 Privacy
All flights will occur over private, limited, or restricted-access areas with the property owner's prior
consent and knowledge. Operations will be conducted by trained crew and all other individuals will
either be a part of the operation or consent to be present at the time of operations.
8 Federal Register Summary
Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the Federal
Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:
Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules: 14 C.F.R. §21, subpart H; 14 C.F.R
45.23(b);14 C.F.R. §§61.113( a) & (b), 61.133(a); 91.7 (a); 91.9 (b) (2); 91.109; 91.119; 91.121;
91.151(a);91.203(a) and (b); 91.405 (a); 91.407 (a) (1); 91.409 (a) (2); 91.409 (a) (2) and 91.417 (a)
& (b) to operates UAS for commercial use.
9 Conclusion
The Ravens seek this exemption to conduct commercial operations using sUAS within restrictedaccess
areas in the NAS. Without this exemption, sUAS innovation will be suppressed, the public
10
economic benefits derived from increased s UAS development will be denied, and the Congressional
directive to accelerate the integration ofUAS into the NAS will be impeded. The sUAS physical and
operational characteristics are compliant with those described in the FMRA and FAA's guidance for
Sec 333 exemptions. The Ravens respectfully request that the FAA gmnt its petition for exemption
from airworthiness.
Please do not hesitate to contact Andrew McCollough, the Regulatory Services POC, via email at
exemption@skyward.io if you have any questions or concerns.
