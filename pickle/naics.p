S'Sector 11--Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and HuntingT \n\n \n\nThe Sector as a Whole \n\nCrop ProductionT \n\n \n   The Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in growing \ncrops, raising animals, harvesting timber, and harvesting fish and other animals from a farm, ranch, or their natural \nhabitats. \n   The establishments in this sector are often described as farms, ranches, dairies, greenhouses, nurseries, orchards, \nor hatcheries.  A farm may consist of a single tract of land or a number of separate tracts which may be held under \ndifferent tenures.  For example, one tract may be owned by the farm operator and another rented.  It may be operated \nby the operator alone or with the assistance of members of the household or hired employees, or it may be operated \nby a partnership, corporation, or other type of organization. When a landowner has one or more tenants, renters, \ncroppers, or managers, the land operated by each is considered a farm. \n   The sector distinguishes two basic activities: agricultural production and agricultural support activities.  \nAgricultural production includes establishments performing the complete farm or ranch operation, such as farm \nowner-operators, tenant farm operators, and sharecroppers.  Agricultural support activities include establishments \nthat perform one or more activities associated with farm operation, such as soil preparation, planting, harvesting, and \nmanagement, on a contract or fee basis. \n   Excluded from the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector are establishments primarily engaged in \nagricultural research and establishments primarily engaged in administering programs for regulating and conserving \nland, mineral, wildlife, and forest use.  These establishments are classified in Industry 54171, Research and \nDevelopment in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences; and Industry 92412, Administration of Conservation \nPrograms, respectively. \n \n111 \n \n   Industries in the Crop Production subsector grow crops mainly for food and fiber.  The subsector comprises \nestablishments, such as farms, orchards, groves, greenhouses, and nurseries, primarily engaged in growing crops, \nplants, vines, or trees and their seeds. \n   The industries in this subsector are grouped by similarity of production activity, including biological and \nphysiological characteristics and economic requirements, the length of growing season, degree of crop rotation, \nextent of input specialization, labor requirements, and capital demands.  The production process is typically \ncompleted when the raw product or commodity grown reaches the "farm gate" for market, that is, at the point of first \nsale or price determination.  \n   Establishments are classified to the Crop Production subsector when crop production (i.e., value of crops for \nmarket) accounts for one-half or more of the establishment\'s total agricultural production.  Within the subsector, \nestablishments are classified to a specific industry when a product or industry family of products (i.e., oilseed and \ngrain farming, vegetable and melon farming, fruit and tree nut farming) account for one-half or more of the \nestablishment\'s agricultural production.  Establishments with one-half or more crop production with no one product \nor family of products of an industry accounting for one-half of the establishment\'s agricultural production are treated \nas general combination crop farming and are classified in Industry 11199, All Other Crop Farming.  \n   Industries in the Crop Production subsector include establishments that own, operate, and manage and those that \noperate and manage.  Those that manage only are classified in Subsector 115, Support Activities for Agriculture and \nForestry.  Establishments that raise aquatic plants in controlled or selected aquatic environments are classified in \nSubsector 112, Animal Production and Aquaculture. \n \n1111  Oilseed and Grain FarmingT \n \n   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in (1) growing oilseed and/or grain crops and/or \n(2) producing oilseed and grain seeds.

Long production cycles use different production processes than short production cycles, which \nrequire more horticultural interventions prior to harvest, resulting in processes more similar to those found in the \nCrop Production subsector.  Consequently, Christmas tree production and other production involving production \ncycles of less than 10 years, are classified in the Crop Production subsector.  \n   Industries in this subsector specialize in different stages of the production cycle.  Reforestation requires production \nof seedlings in specialized nurseries.  Timber production requires natural forest or suitable areas of land that are \navailable for a long duration.  The maturation time for timber depends upon the species of tree, the climatic \nconditions of the region, and the intended purpose of the timber.  The harvesting of timber (except when done on an \nextremely small scale) requires specialized machinery unique to the industry.

The term mining is used in the broad sense to include quarrying, well operations, beneficiating (e.g., crushing, \nscreening, washing, and flotation), and other preparation customarily performed at the mine site, or as a part of \nmining activity. \n   The Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector distinguishes two basic activities: mine operation and \nmining support activities.  Mine operation includes establishments operating mines, quarries, or oil and gas wells on \ntheir own account or for others on a contract or fee basis.  Mining support activities include establishments that \nperform exploration (except geophysical surveying) and/or other mining services on a contract or fee basis (except \nmine site preparation and construction of oil/gas pipelines). \n   Establishments in the Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector are grouped and classified according \nto the natural resource mined or to be mined.  Industries include establishments that develop the mine site, extract \nthe natural resources, and/or those that beneficiate (i.e., prepare) the mineral mined.  Beneficiation is the process \nwhereby the extracted material is reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former \nsuitable for further processing or direct use.  The operations that take place in beneficiation are primarily \nmechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, and centrifugal separation.  In contrast, manufacturing \noperations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as electrolysis and distillation.  However, \nsome treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both the beneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e., \nsmelting/refining) stages.  The range of preparation activities varies by mineral and the purity of any given ore \ndeposit.  While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require little or no preparation, others are washed \nand screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed into bullion before leaving the mine site. \n   Mining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location.  Separate receipts will be \ncollected for these activities whenever possible.  When receipts cannot be broken out between mining and \nmanufacturing, establishments that mine or quarry nonmetallic minerals, and then beneficiate the nonmetallic \nminerals into more finished manufactured products are classified based on the primary activity of the establishment.  \nA mine that manufactures a small amount of finished products will be classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, \nand Oil and Gas Extraction.  An establishment that mines whose primary output is a more finished manufactured \nproduct will be classified in Sector 31-33, Manufacturing. \n \n211 \n \n   Industries in the Oil and Gas Extraction subsector operate and/or develop oil and gas field properties.  Such \nactivities may include exploration for crude petroleum and natural gas; drilling, completing, and equipping wells; \noperating separators, emulsion breakers, desilting equipment, and field gathering lines for crude petroleum and \nnatural gas; and all other activities in the preparation of oil and gas up to the point of shipment from the producing \nproperty.  This subsector includes the production of crude petroleum, the mining and extraction of oil from oil shale \nand oil sands, and the production of natural gas, sulfur recovery from natural gas, and recovery of hydrocarbon \nliquids. \n   Establishments in this subsector include those that operate oil and gas wells on their own account or for others on a \ncontract or fee basis.  Establishments primarily engaged in providing support services, on a fee or contract basis, \nrequired for the drilling or operation of oil and gas wells (except geophysical surveying and mapping, mine site \npreparation, and construction of oil/gas pipelines) are classified in Subsector 213, Support Activities for Mining. \n \n2111  Oil and Gas ExtractionT \n \n21111  Oil and Gas ExtractionT \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or developing oil and gas field \nproperties and establishments primarily engaged in recovering liquid hydrocarbons from oil and gas field gases.  \nSuch activities may include exploration for crude petroleum and natural gas; drilling, completing, and equipping \nwells; operation of separators, emulsion breakers, desilting equipment, and field gathering lines for crude petroleum \n\nOil and Gas ExtractionT \n\n\x0cand natural gas; and all other activities in the preparation of oil and gas up to the point of shipment from the \nproducing property.  This industry includes the production of crude petroleum, the mining and extraction of oil from \noil shale and oil sands, the production of natural gas, sulfur recovery from natural gas, and the recovery of \nhydrocarbon liquids from oil and gas field gases.

The term "mining" is used \nin the broad sense to include ore extraction, quarrying, and beneficiating (e.g., crushing, screening, washing, sizing, \nconcentrating, and flotation), customarily done at the mine site. \n   Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles which can be separated into \nmineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  The operations that take place in \nbeneficiation are primarily mechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, centrifugal separation, and \n\n\x0cso on. In contrast, manufacturing operations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as \nelectrolysis, distillation, and so on.  However some treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both stages: the \nbeneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e., smelting/refining) stages.  The range of preparation activities varies by \nmineral and the purity of any given ore deposit.  While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require \nlittle or no preparation, others are washed and screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed \ninto bullion before leaving the mine site. \n   Establishments in the Mining (except Oil and Gas) subsector include those that have complete responsibility for \noperating mines and quarries (except oil and gas wells) and those that operate mines and quarries (except oil and gas \nwells) for others on a contract or fee basis.

Establishments primarily engaged in the preparation of \nsites for new construction and establishments primarily engaged in subdividing land for sale as building sites also \nare included in this sector. \n   Construction work done may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs.  Activities of \nthese establishments generally are managed at a fixed place of business, but they usually perform construction \nactivities at multiple project sites.  Production responsibilities for establishments in this sector are usually specified \nin (1) contracts with the owners of construction projects (prime contracts) or (2) contracts with other construction \nestablishments (subcontracts). \n   Establishments primarily engaged in contracts that include responsibility for all aspects of individual construction \nprojects are commonly known as general contractors, but also may be known as design-builders, construction \nmanagers, turnkey contractors, or (in cases where two or more establishments jointly secure a general contract) \njoint-venture contractors.  Construction managers that provide oversight and scheduling only (i.e., agency) as well as \nconstruction managers that are responsible for the entire project (i.e., at risk) are included as general contractor type \nestablishments.  Establishments of the "general contractor type" frequently arrange construction of separate parts of \ntheir projects through subcontracts with other construction establishments. \n   Establishments primarily engaged in activities to produce a specific component (e.g., masonry, painting, and \nelectrical work) of a construction project are commonly known as specialty trade contractors.  Activities of specialty \ntrade contractors are usually subcontracted from other construction establishments, but especially in remodeling and \nrepair construction, the work may be done directly for the owner of the property. \n   Establishments primarily engaged in activities to construct buildings to be sold on sites that they own are known as \nfor-sale builders, but also may be known as speculative builders or merchant builders.  For-sale builders produce \nbuildings in a manner similar to general contractors, but their production processes also include site acquisition and \nsecuring of financial backing. For-sale builders are most often associated with the construction of residential \nbuildings.  Like general contractors, they may subcontract all or part of the actual construction work on their \nbuildings. \n   There are substantial differences in the types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by \nestablishments in this sector.  To highlight these differences and variations in the underlying production functions, \nthis sector is divided into three subsectors. \n    Subsector 236, Construction of Buildings, comprises establishments of the general contractor type and for-sale \nbuilders involved in the construction of buildings.  Subsector 237, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, \ncomprises establishments involved in the construction of engineering projects. Subsector 238, Specialty Trade \nContractors, comprises establishments engaged in specialty trade activities generally needed in the construction of \nall types of buildings. \n   Force account construction is construction work performed by an enterprise primarily engaged in some business \nother than construction for its own account, using employees of the enterprise.  This activity is not included in the \nconstruction sector unless the construction work performed is the primary activity of a separate establishment of the \nenterprise.  The installation and the ongoing repair and maintenance of telecommunications and utility networks is \nexcluded from construction when the establishments performing the work are not independent contractors.  \nAlthough a growing proportion of this work is subcontracted to independent contractors in the Construction sector, \nthe operating units of telecommunications and utility companies performing this work are included with the \ntelecommunications or utility activities. \n \n236 \n \n   The Construction of Buildings subsector comprises establishments primarily responsible for the construction of \nbuildings.  The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs.  The on-\nsite assembly of precut, panelized, and prefabricated buildings and construction of temporary buildings are included \nin this subsector.  Part or all of the production work for which the establishments in this subsector have \nresponsibility may be subcontracted to other construction establishments--usually specialty trade contractors. \n\nConstruction of BuildingsT \n\n\x0c   Establishments in this subsector are classified based on the types of buildings they construct.  This classification \nreflects variations in the requirements of the underlying production processes. \n \n2361  Residential Building ConstructionT \n \n23611  Residential Building ConstructionT \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily responsible for the construction or remodeling and renovation of \nsingle-family and multifamily residential buildings.  Included in this industry are residential housing general \ncontractors (i.e., new construction, remodeling, or renovating existing residential structures), for-sale builders and \nremodelers of residential structures, residential project construction management firms, and residential design-build \nfirms. \n \nCross-References. \n \n\nEstablishments primarily engaged in-- \n\n\xef\x82\xb7 \n\n\xef\x82\xb7 \n\n\xef\x82\xb7 \n\nPerforming specialized construction work on houses and other residential buildings, generally on a \nsubcontract basis--are classified in Subsector 238, Specialty Trade Contractors; \nPerforming manufactured (mobile) home setup and tie-down work--are classified in Industry 23899, All \nOther Specialty Trade Contractors; and \nConstructing and leasing residential buildings on their own account--are classified in Industry 53111, \nLessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings. \n\n\xef\x82\xb7 \n\n\xef\x82\xb7 \n\n\xef\x82\xb7 \n\n\xef\x82\xb7 \n\n\xef\x82\xb7 \n\n\xef\x82\xb7 \n\n \n236115  New Single-Family Housing Construction (except For-Sale Builders)   \n \n   This U.S. industry comprises general contractor establishments primarily responsible for the entire construction of \nnew single-family housing, such as single-family detached houses and town houses or row houses where each \nhousing unit (1) is separated from its neighbors by a ground-to-roof wall and (2) has no housing units constructed \nabove or below.

The assembling of component parts of \nmanufactured products is considered manufacturing, except in cases where the activity is appropriately classified in \nSector 23, Construction. \n   Establishments in the Manufacturing sector are often described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically \nuse power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment.  However, establishments that transform materials or \nsubstances into new products by hand or in the worker\'s home and those engaged in selling to the general public \nproducts made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors, \nmay also be included in this sector.  Manufacturing establishments may process materials or may contract with other \nestablishments to process their materials for them.  Both types of establishments are included in manufacturing. \n   The materials, substances, or components transformed by manufacturing establishments are raw materials that are \nproducts of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing \nestablishments.  The materials used may be purchased directly from producers, obtained through customary trade \nchannels, or secured without recourse to the market by transferring the product from one establishment to another, \nunder the same ownership. \n   The new product of a manufacturing establishment may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization or \nconsumption, or it may be semifinished to become an input for an establishment engaged in further manufacturing.  \nFor example, the product of the alumina refinery is the input used in the primary production of aluminum; primary \naluminum is the input to an aluminum wire drawing plant; and aluminum wire is the input for a fabricated wire \nproduct manufacturing establishment. \n   The subsectors in the Manufacturing sector generally reflect distinct production processes related to material \ninputs, production equipment, and employee skills. In the machinery area, where assembling is a key activity, parts \nand accessories for manufactured products are classified in the industry of the finished manufactured item when they \nare made for separate sale.  For example, a replacement refrigerator door would be classified with refrigerators and \nan attachment for a piece of metal working machinery would be classified with metal working machinery.  \nHowever, components, input from other manufacturing establishments, are classified based on the production \nfunction of the component manufacturer.  For example, electronic components are classified in Subsector 334, \nComputer and Electronic Product Manufacturing and stampings are classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal \nProduct Manufacturing. \n   Manufacturing establishments often perform one or more activities that are classified outside the Manufacturing \nsector of NAICS.  For instance, almost all manufacturing has some captive research and development or \nadministrative operations, such as accounting, payroll, or management.  These captive services are treated the same \nas captive manufacturing activities.  When the services are provided by separate establishments, they are classified \nto the NAICS sector where such services are primary, not in manufacturing.  \n   The boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry.  The \nestablishments in the manufacturing sector are engaged in the transformation of materials into new products.  Their \noutput is a new product.  However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective.  As \nclarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in NAICS: \n \nMilk bottling and pasteurizing;                                            Grinding of lenses to prescription; \nWater bottling and processing;                                            Wood preserving; \nFresh fish packaging (oyster shucking,                               Electroplating, plating, metal heat  \n  fish filleting);                                                                        treating, and polishing for the trade; \nApparel jobbing (assigning of materials                              Lapidary work for the trade; \n  to contract factories or shops for                                        Fabricating signs and advertising displays; \n  fabrication or other contract operations)                            Rebuilding or remanufacturing  \n  as well as contracting on materials owned by others;          machinery (i.e., automotive parts); \nPrinting and related activities;                                             Ship repair and renovation; \nReady-mixed concrete production;                                     Machine shops; and \nLeather converting;                                                             Tire retreading. \n \n\n\x0c   Conversely, there are activities that are sometimes considered manufacturing, but which for NAICS are classified \nin another sector (i.e., not classified as manufacturing). They include: \n \n   1. Logging, classified in Sector 11, Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, is considered a harvesting \noperation; \n \n   2. The beneficiating of ores and other minerals, classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas \nExtraction, is considered part of the activity of mining; \n \n   3. The construction of structures and fabricating operations performed at the site of construction by contractors, is \nclassified in Sector 23, Construction; \n \n   4. Establishments engaged in breaking of bulk and redistribution in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, \nor bottling products, such as liquors or chemicals; the customized assembly of computers; sorting of scrap; mixing \npaints to customer order; and cutting metals to customer order, classified in Sector 42, Wholesale Trade or Sector \n44-45, Retail Trade, produce a modified version of the same product, not a new product; and \n \n   5. Publishing and the combined activity of publishing and printing, classified in Sector 51, Information, perform \nthe transformation of information into a product whereas the value of the product to the consumer lies in the \ninformation content, not in the format in which it is distributed (i.e., the book or software diskette). \n \n311 \n \n   Industries in the Food Manufacturing subsector transform livestock and agricultural products into products for \nintermediate or final consumption.  The industry groups are distinguished by the raw materials (generally of animal \nor vegetable origin) processed into food products. \n   The food products manufactured in these establishments are typically sold to wholesalers or retailers for \ndistribution to consumers, but establishments primarily engaged in retailing bakery and candy products made on the \npremises not for immediate consumption are included. \n   Establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing beverages are classified in Subsector 312, Beverage and \nTobacco Product Manufacturing. \n \n3111  Animal Food ManufacturingT \n \n31111  Animal Food ManufacturingT \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing food and feed for animals from \ningredients, such as grains, oilseed mill products, and meat products. \n \nCross-References. \n \n\nEstablishments primarily engaged in-- \n\nFood ManufacturingT \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  Slaughtering animals for feed--are classified in Industry 31161, Animal Slaughtering and Processing;

The \nmanufacturing of these products is grouped together because they constitute a series of vertically connected \nprocesses.  More than one is often carried out in a single establishment.  There are essentially three activities.  The \nmanufacturing of pulp involves separating the cellulose fibers from other impurities in wood or used paper.  The \nmanufacturing of paper involves matting these fibers into a sheet.  Converted paper products are made from paper \nand other materials by various cutting and shaping techniques and includes coating and laminating activities. \n   The Paper Manufacturing subsector is subdivided into two industry groups, the first for the manufacturing of pulp \nand paper and the second for the manufacturing of converted paper products.  Paper making is treated as the core \nactivity of the subsector.  Therefore, any establishment that makes paper (including paperboard), either alone or in \ncombination with pulp manufacturing or paper converting, is classified as a paper or paperboard mill.  \nEstablishments that make pulp without making paper are classified as pulp mills.  Pulp mills, paper mills and \npaperboard mills comprise the first industry group. \n   Establishments that make products from purchased paper and other materials make up the second industry group, \nConverted Paper Product Manufacturing.  This general activity is then subdivided based, for the most part, on \nprocess distinctions.  Paperboard container manufacturing uses corrugating, cutting, and shaping machinery to form \npaperboard into containers.  Paper bag and coated and treated paper manufacturing establishments cut and coat \npaper and foil.  Stationery product manufacturing establishments make a variety of paper products used for writing, \nfiling, and similar applications.  Other converted paper product manufacturing includes, in particular, the conversion \nof sanitary paper stock into such things as tissue paper and disposable diapers.  \n   An important process used in the Paper Bag and Coated and Treated Paper Manufacturing industry is lamination, \noften combined with coating.  Lamination and coating makes a composite material with improved properties of \nstrength, impermeability, and so on.  The laminated materials may be paper, metal foil, or plastics film. While paper \nis often one of the components, it is not always.  Lamination of plastics film to plastics film is classified in the \nNAICS Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing, because establishments that do this often first \n\n\x0cmake the film.  The same situation holds with respect to bags.  The manufacturing of bags from plastics only, \nwhether or not laminated, is classified in Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing, but all other \nbag manufacturing is classified in this subsector.  \n   Excluded from this subsector are photosensitive papers.  These papers are chemically treated and are classified in \nIndustry 32599, All Other Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing. \n \n3221 \n \n   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing pulp, paper, or paperboard. \n \n32211  Pulp MillsT \n\nPulp, Paper, and Paperboard MillsT \n\nSee industry description for 322110 below. \n\n \n322110  Pulp Mills  \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing pulp without manufacturing paper or \npaperboard.  The pulp is made by separating the cellulose fibers from the other impurities in wood or other \nmaterials, such as used or recycled rags, linters, scrap paper, and straw. \n \nCross-References. \n \n\nEstablishments primarily engaged in-- \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  Manufacturing both pulp and paper--are classified in Industry 32212, Paper Mills; and \n\xef\x82\xb7  Manufacturing both pulp and paperboard--are classified in Industry 322130, Paperboard Mills. \n\n \n32212  Paper MillsT \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing paper from pulp.

The support activities included here are an integral part of the \nprinting industry, and a product (a printing plate, a bound book, or a computer disk or file) that is an integral part of \nthe printing industry is almost always provided by these operations.  \n   Processes used in printing include a variety of methods used to transfer an image from a plate, screen, film, or \ncomputer file to some medium, such as paper, plastics, metal, textile articles, or wood.  The printing processes \nemployed include, but are not limited to, lithographic, gravure, screen, flexographic, digital, and letterpress.  \n   In contrast to many other classification systems that locate publishing of printed materials in manufacturing, \nNAICS classifies the publishing of printed products in Subsector 511, Publishing Industries (except Internet).  \nThough printing and publishing are often carried out by the same enterprise (a newspaper, for example), it is less \nand less the case that these distinct activities are carried out in the same establishment.  When publishing and \nprinting are done in the same establishment, the establishment is classified in Sector 51, Information, in the \nappropriate NAICS industry even if the receipts for printing exceed those for publishing.  \n   This subsector includes printing on clothing because the production process for that activity is printing, not \nclothing manufacturing.  For instance, the printing of T-shirts is included in this subsector. In contrast, printing on \nfabric (or grey goods) is not included.  This activity is part of the process of finishing the fabric and is included in \nthe NAICS Textile Mills subsector in Industry 31331, Textile and Fabric Finishing Mills. \n \n3231 \n \n32311  PrintingT \n  \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in printing on apparel and textile products, paper, metal, \nglass, plastics, and other materials, except fabric (grey goods).

The core technology employed by establishments in this subsector is that of plastics or \nrubber product production.  Plastics and rubber are combined in the same subsector because plastics are increasingly \nbeing used as a substitute for rubber; however the subsector is generally restricted to the production of products \nmade of just one material, either solely plastics or rubber.  \n   Many manufacturing activities use plastics or rubber, for example the manufacture of footwear, or furniture.  \nTypically, the production process of these products involves more than one material. In these cases, technologies \nthat allow disparate materials to be formed and combined are of central importance in describing the manufacturing \nactivity.  In NAICS, such activities (the footwear and furniture manufacturing) are not classified in the Plastics and \nRubber Products Manufacturing subsector because the core technologies for these activities are diverse and involve \nmultiple materials.  \n   Within the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector, a distinction is made between plastics and \nrubber products at the industry group level, although it is not a rigid distinction, as can be seen from the definition of \nIndustry 32622, Rubber and Plastics Hoses and Belting Manufacturing.  As materials technology progresses, plastics \nare increasingly being used as a substitute for rubber; and eventually, the distinction may disappear as a basis for \nestablishment classification.  \n   In keeping with the core technology focus of plastics, lamination of plastics film to plastics film as well as the \nproduction of bags from plastics only is classified in this subsector.  Lamination and bag production involving \nplastics and materials other than plastics are classified in the NAICS Subsector 322, Paper Manufacturing. \n \n3261 \n \n   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in processing new or spent (i.e., recycled) \nplastics resins into intermediate or final products, using such processes as compression molding; extrusion molding; \ninjection molding; blow molding; and casting. Within most of these industries, the production process is such that a \nwide variety of products can be made. \n \n32611  Plastics Packaging Materials and Unlaminated Film and Sheet ManufacturingT \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in (1) converting plastics resins into unsupported \nplastics film and sheet and/or (2) forming, coating or laminating plastics film and sheet into plastics bags. \n \nCross-References. \n \n\nEstablishments primarily engaged in-- \n\nPlastics Product ManufacturingT \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  Laminating plastics sheet (except for packaging)--are classified in Industry 32613, Laminated Plastics \n\nPlate, Sheet (except Packaging), and Shape Manufacturing; \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  Manufacturing plastics blister and bubble packaging--are classified in Industry 32619, Other Plastics \n\nProduct Manufacturing; and \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  Coating or laminating combinations of plastics, foils and paper (except plastics film to plastics film) into \n\nfilm, sheet or bags--are classified in Industry 32222, Paper Bag and Coated and Treated Paper \nManufacturing. \n\n \n326111  Plastics Bag and Pouch Manufacturing  \n \n   This U.S. Industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in: (1) converting plastics resins into plastics bags \nor pouches, and/or (2) forming, coating, or laminating plastics film or sheet into single web or multi-web plastics \nbags or pouches.

Heat often is used in the process and \nchemicals are frequently mixed to change the composition, purity, and chemical properties for the intended product.  \nFor example, glass is produced by heating silica sand to the melting point (sometimes combined with cullet or \nrecycled glass) and then drawn, floated, or blow molded to the desired shape or thickness.  Refractory materials are \nheated and then formed into bricks or other shapes for use in industrial applications.  \n   The Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector includes establishments that manufacture products, \nsuch as bricks, refractories, ceramic products, and glass and glass products, such as plate glass and containers.  Also \nincluded are cement and concrete products, lime, gypsum and other nonmetallic mineral products including abrasive \nproducts, ceramic plumbing fixtures, statuary, cut stone products, and mineral wool.  The products are used in a \nwide range of activities from construction and heavy and light manufacturing to articles for personal use.  \n   Mining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location.  Separate receipts will be \ncollected for these activities whenever possible.  When receipts cannot be broken out between mining and \nmanufacturing, establishments that mine or quarry nonmetallic minerals, beneficiate the nonmetallic minerals and \nfurther process the nonmetallic minerals into a more finished manufactured product are classified based on the \nprimary activity of the establishment.  A mine that manufactures a small amount of finished products will be \nclassified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.  An establishment that mines whose primary \noutput is a more finished manufactured product will be classified in the Manufacturing Sector.  \n   Excluded from the Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector are establishments that primarily \nbeneficiate mined nonmetallic minerals.  Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to \nparticles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  \nBeneficiation establishments are included in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction. \n \n3271  Clay Product and Refractory ManufacturingT \n\n\x0cSee industry description for 327110 below. \n\n \n32711  Pottery, Ceramics, and Plumbing Fixture ManufacturingT \n \n \n327110  Pottery, Ceramics, and Plumbing Fixture Manufacturing \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in shaping, molding, glazing, and firing pottery, \nceramics, plumbing fixtures, and electrical supplies made entirely or partly of clay or other ceramic materials. \n \nIllustrative Examples: \n \nBathroom accessories, vitreous china and earthenware, manufacturing \nCeramic or ferrite permanent magnets manufacturing \nChemical stoneware (i.e., pottery products) manufacturing \nClay and ceramic statuary manufacturing \nEarthenware table and kitchen articles, coarse, manufacturing \nPorcelain electrical insulators manufacturing \nVitreous china plumbing fixtures manufacturing \n \nCross-References. \n \n\nEstablishments primarily engaged in-- \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  Manufacturing enameled iron and steel plumbing fixtures--are classified in U.S. Industry 332999, All Other \n\nMiscellaneous Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing;

Establishments in this \nsubsector also manufacture metal alloys and superalloys by introducing other chemical elements to pure metals.  The \noutput of smelting and refining, usually in ingot form, is used in rolling, drawing, and extruding operations to make \nsheet, strip, bar, rod, or wire, and in molten form to make castings and other basic metal products.  \n   Primary manufacturing of ferrous and nonferrous metals begins with ore or concentrate as the primary input.  \nEstablishments manufacturing primary metals from ore and/or concentrate remain classified in the primary smelting, \nprimary refining, or iron and steel mill industries regardless of the form of their output.  Establishments primarily \nengaged in secondary smelting and/or secondary refining recover ferrous and nonferrous metals from scrap and/or \ndross.  The output of the secondary smelting and/or secondary refining industries is limited to shapes such as ingot \nor billet that will be further processed.  Recovery of metals from scrap often occurs in establishments that are \nprimarily engaged in activities, such as rolling, drawing, extruding, or similar processes.  \n   Excluded from the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector are establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing \nferrous and nonferrous forgings (except ferrous forgings made in steel mills) and stampings.

Some important processes for the manufacture of \nmachinery are forging, stamping, bending, forming, and machining that are used to shape individual pieces of metal.  \nProcesses, such as welding and assembling are used to join separate parts together.  Although these processes are \nsimilar to those used in metal fabricating establishments, machinery manufacturing is different because it typically \nemploys multiple metal forming processes in manufacturing the various parts of the machine.  Moreover, complex \nassembly operations are an inherent part of the production process.  \n   In general, design considerations are very important in machinery production. Establishments specialize in making \nmachinery designed for particular applications.  Thus, design is considered to be part of the production process for \nthe purpose of implementing NAICS.  The NAICS structure reflects this by defining industries and industry groups \nthat make machinery for different applications.  A broad distinction exists between machinery that is generally used \nin a variety of industrial applications (i.e., general purpose machinery) and machinery that is designed to be used in \na particular industry (i.e., special purpose machinery).  Three industry groups consist of special purpose machinery--\nAgricultural, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing; Industrial Machinery Manufacturing; and \nCommercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing.  The other industry groups make general-purpose \nmachinery: Ventilation, Heating, Air-Conditioning, and Commercial Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturing; \nMetalworking Machinery Manufacturing; Engine, Turbine, and Power Transmission Equipment Manufacturing; and \nOther General Purpose Machinery Manufacturing. \n \n3331  Agriculture, Construction, and Mining Machinery ManufacturingT \n \n33311  Agricultural Implement ManufacturingT \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing farm machinery and equipment, \npowered mowing equipment and other powered home lawn and garden equipment. \n \nIllustrative Examples: \n \nCombines (i.e., harvester-threshers) manufacturing \n\n\x0cCotton ginning machinery manufacturing \nFertilizing machinery, farm-type, manufacturing \nHaying machines manufacturing \nMilking machines manufacturing \nPlanting machines, farm-type, manufacturing \nPlows, farm-type, manufacturing \nPoultry brooders, feeders, and waterers manufacturing \nPowered lawnmowers manufacturing \nSnowblowers and throwers, residential-type, manufacturing \nTractors and attachments, lawn and garden-type and farm-type, manufacturing \n \nCross-References. \n \n\nEstablishments primarily engaged in-- \n\nManufacturing. \n\n \n333112  Lawn and Garden Tractor and Home Lawn and Garden Equipment Manufacturing  \n \n   This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing powered lawnmowers, lawn and \ngarden tractors, and other home lawn and garden equipment, such as tillers, shredders, yard vacuums, and leaf \nblowers. \n \nCross-References. \n\nEstablishments primarily engaged in-- \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  Manufacturing agricultural handtools and nonpowered lawnmowers--are classified in Industry 33221, \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  Manufacturing farm conveyors--are classified in Industry 33392, Material Handling Equipment \n\nCutlery and Handtool Manufacturing;

The Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing industries \nhave been combined in the hierarchy of NAICS because of the economic significance they have attained.  Their \n\n\x0crapid growth suggests that they will become even more important to the economies of all three North American \ncountries in the future, and in addition their manufacturing processes are fundamentally different from the \nmanufacturing processes of other machinery and equipment.  The design and use of integrated circuits and the \napplication of highly specialized miniaturization technologies are common elements in the production technologies \nof the computer and electronic subsector.  Convergence of technology motivates this NAICS subsector.  \nDigitalization of sound recording, for example, causes both the medium (the compact disc) and the equipment to \nresemble the technologies for recording, storing, transmitting, and manipulating data.  Communications technology \nand equipment have been converging with computer technology.  When technologically-related components are in \nthe same sector, it makes it easier to adjust the classification for future changes, without needing to redefine its basic \nstructure.  The creation of the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector assists in delineating new \nand emerging industries because the activities that will serve as the probable sources of new industries, such as \ncomputer manufacturing and communications equipment manufacturing, or computers and audio equipment, are \nbrought together.  As new activities emerge, they are less likely therefore, to cross the subsector boundaries of the \nclassification. \n \n \n3341  Computer and Peripheral Equipment ManufacturingT \n \n33411  Computer and Peripheral Equipment ManufacturingT \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing and/or assembling electronic \ncomputers, such as mainframes, personal computers, workstations, laptops, and computer servers; and computer \nperipheral equipment, such as storage devices, printers, monitors, input/output devices and terminals.

\n\nManufacturing; \n\nManufacturing; and \n\n\x0cFurniture and Related Product ManufacturingT \n\n \n337 \n \n   Industries in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector make furniture and related articles, such \nas mattresses, window blinds, cabinets, and fixtures.  The processes used in the manufacture of furniture include the \ncutting, bending, molding, laminating, and assembly of such materials as wood, metal, glass, plastics, and rattan.  \nHowever, the production process for furniture is not solely bending metal, cutting and shaping wood, or extruding \nand molding plastics.  Design and fashion trends play an important part in the production of furniture.  The \nintegrated design of the article for both esthetic and functional qualities is also a major part of the process of \nmanufacturing furniture.  Design services may be performed by the furniture establishment\'s work force or may be \npurchased from industrial designers. \n   Furniture may be made of any material, but the most common ones used in North America are metal and wood.  \nFurniture manufacturing establishments may specialize in making articles primarily from one material.  Some of the \nequipment required to make a wooden table, for example, is different from that used to make a metal one.  However, \nfurniture is usually made from several materials.  A wooden table might have metal brackets, and a wooden chair a \nfabric or plastics seat.  Therefore, in NAICS, furniture initially is classified based on the type of furniture \n(application for which it is designed) rather than the material used.  For example, an upholstered sofa is treated as \nhousehold furniture, although it may also be used in hotels or offices.  \n   When classifying furniture according to the component material from which it is made, furniture made from more \nthan one material is classified based on the material used in the frame, or if there is no frame, the predominant \ncomponent material.  Upholstered household furniture (excluding kitchen and dining room chairs with upholstered \nseats) is classified without regard to the frame material.  Kitchen or dining room chairs with upholstered seats are \nclassified according to the frame material. \n   Furniture may be made on a stock or custom basis and may be shipped assembled or unassembled (i.e., \nknockdown).  The manufacture of furniture parts and frames is included in this subsector. \n   Some of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of \nmanufacturing.  For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in \nSubsector 321, Wood Product Manufacturing.  However, the multiple processes that distinguish wood furniture \nmanufacturing from wood product manufacturing warrant inclusion of wooden furniture manufacturing in the \nFurniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector.  Metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also \nemployed in the manufacturing of roll-formed products classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product \nManufacturing.  The molding process for plastics furniture is similar to the molding of other plastics products.  \nHowever, plastics furniture producing establishments tend to specialize in furniture.  \n   NAICS attempts to keep furniture manufacturing together, but there are two notable exceptions: seating for \ntransportation equipment and specialized hospital furniture (e.g., hospital beds and operating tables).  These \nexceptions are related to the fact that some of the aspects of the production process for these products, primarily the \ndesign, are highly integrated with the other manufactured goods, namely motor vehicles and health equipment. \n \n3371  Household and Institutional Furniture and Kitchen Cabinet ManufacturingT \n \n   This industry group comprises establishments manufacturing household-type furniture, such as living room, \nkitchen and bedroom furniture and institutional (i.e., public building) furniture, such as furniture for schools, \ntheaters, and churches. \n \n33711  Wood Kitchen Cabinet and Countertop ManufacturingT \n\nSee industry description for 337110 below. \n\n \n337110  Wood Kitchen Cabinet and Countertop Manufacturing \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing wood or plastics laminated on wood \nkitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities, and countertops (except freestanding).

The merchandise described in this \nsector includes the outputs of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and certain information industries, such as \npublishing. \n   The wholesaling process is an intermediate step in the distribution of merchandise.  Wholesalers are organized to \nsell or arrange the purchase or sale of (a) goods for resale (i.e., goods sold to other wholesalers or retailers), (b) \ncapital or durable nonconsumer goods, and (c) raw and intermediate materials and supplies used in production. \n   Wholesalers sell merchandise to other businesses and normally operate from a warehouse or office.  These \nwarehouses and offices are characterized by having little or no display of merchandise.  In addition, neither the \ndesign nor the location of the premises is intended to solicit walk-in traffic.  Wholesalers do not normally use \nadvertising directed to the general public.  Customers are generally reached initially via telephone, in-person \nmarketing, or by specialized advertising that may include Internet and other electronic means.  Follow-up orders are \neither vendor-initiated or client-initiated, generally based on previous sales, and typically exhibit strong ties between \nsellers and buyers.  In fact, transactions are often conducted between wholesalers and clients that have long-standing \nbusiness relationships. \n   This sector comprises two main types of wholesalers: merchant wholesalers that sell goods on their own account \nand business-to-business electronic markets, agents, and brokers that arrange sales and purchases for others \ngenerally for a commission or fee. \n   (1)   Establishments that sell goods on their own account are known as wholesale merchants, distributors, jobbers, \ndrop shippers, and import/export merchants.  Also included as wholesale merchants are sales offices and sales \nbranches (but not retail stores) maintained by manufacturing, refining, or mining enterprises apart from their plants \nor mines for the purpose of marketing their products and group purchasing organizations (e.g., purchasing and \nselling goods on their own account).  Merchant wholesale establishments typically maintain their own warehouse, \nwhere they receive and handle goods for their customers.  Goods are generally sold without transformation, but may \ninclude integral functions, such as sorting, packaging, labeling, and other marketing services. \n   (2)   Establishments arranging for the purchase or sale of goods owned by others or purchasing goods, generally on \na commission basis are known as business-to-business electronic markets, agents and brokers, commission \nmerchants, import/export agents and brokers, auction companies, group purchasing organization (e.g., purchasing or \narranging for the purchases of goods owned by others), and manufacturers\' representatives.  These establishments \noperate from offices and generally do not own or handle the goods they sell. \n   Some wholesale establishments may be connected with a single manufacturer and promote and sell the particular \nmanufacturers\' products to a wide range of other wholesalers or retailers.  Other wholesalers may be connected to a \nretail chain, or limited number of retail chains, and only provide a variety of products needed by that particular retail \noperation(s).  These wholesalers may obtain the products from a wide range of manufacturers.  Still other \nwholesalers may not take title to the goods, but act as agents and brokers for a commission. \n   Although, in general, wholesaling normally denotes sales in large volumes, durable nonconsumer goods may be \nsold in single units.  Sales of capital or durable nonconsumer goods used in the production of goods and services, \nsuch as farm machinery, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and industrial machinery, are always included in \nwholesale trade. \n \n423  Merchant Wholesalers, Durable Goods  \n \n   Industries in the Merchant Wholesalers, Durable Goods subsector sell capital or durable goods to other businesses.  \nMerchant wholesalers generally take title to the goods that they sell; in other words, they buy and sell goods on their \nown account.  Durable goods are new or used items generally with a normal life expectancy of three years or more.  \nDurable goods merchant wholesale trade establishments are engaged in wholesaling products, such as motor \nvehicles, furniture, construction materials, machinery and equipment (including household-type appliances), metals \nand minerals (except petroleum), sporting goods, toys and hobby goods, recyclable materials, and parts. \n   Business-to-business electronic markets, agents, and brokers primarily engaged in wholesaling durable goods, \ngenerally on a commission or fee basis, are classified in Subsector 425, Wholesale Electronic Markets and Agents \nand Brokers. \n\n\x0c \n4231  Motor Vehicle and Motor Vehicle Parts and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers  \n \n   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in the merchant wholesale distribution of \nautomobiles and other motor vehicles, motor vehicle supplies, tires, and new and used parts. \n \n42311  Automobile and Other Motor Vehicle Merchant Wholesalers  \n\nSee industry description for 423110 below. \n\n \n423110  Automobile and Other Motor Vehicle Merchant Wholesalers  \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in the merchant wholesale distribution of new and used \npassenger automobiles, trucks, trailers, and other motor vehicles, such as motorcycles, motor homes, and \nsnowmobiles. \n \n42312  Motor Vehicle Supplies and New Parts Merchant Wholesalers  \n\nSee industry description for 423120 below. \n\n \n423120  Motor Vehicle Supplies and New Parts Merchant Wholesalers  \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in the merchant wholesale distribution of motor vehicle \nsupplies, accessories, tools, and equipment;

This sector comprises two main types of retailers: store and \nnonstore retailers. \n \n1.   Store retailers operate fixed point-of-sale locations, located and designed to attract a high volume of walk-in \ncustomers.  In general, retail stores have extensive displays of merchandise and use mass-media advertising to \nattract customers.  They typically sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption, but \nsome also serve business and institutional clients.  These include establishments, such as office supply stores, \ncomputer and software stores, building materials dealers, plumbing supply stores, and electrical supply stores.  \nCatalog showrooms, gasoline stations, automotive dealers, and mobile home dealers are treated as store retailers. \n   In addition to retailing merchandise, some types of store retailers are also engaged in the provision of after-sales \nservices, such as repair and installation.  For example, new automobile dealers, electronics and appliance stores, and \nmusical instrument and supplies stores often provide repair services.  As a general rule, establishments engaged in \nretailing merchandise and providing after-sales services are classified in this sector. \n   The first eleven subsectors of retail trade are store retailers.  The establishments are grouped into industries and \nindustry groups typically based on one or more of the following criteria: \n \n   (a) The merchandise line or lines carried by the store; for example, specialty stores are distinguished from general-\nline stores. \n \n   (b) The usual trade designation of the establishments.  This criterion applies in cases where a store type is well \nrecognized by the industry and the public, but difficult to define strictly in terms of merchandise lines carried; for \nexample, pharmacies, hardware stores, and department stores. \n \n   (c) Capital requirements in terms of display equipment; for example, food stores have equipment requirements not \nfound in other retail industries. \n \n   (d) Human resource requirements in terms of expertise; for example, the staff of an automobile dealer requires \nknowledge in financing, registering, and licensing issues that are not necessary in other retail industries. \n \n2.   Nonstore retailers, like store retailers, are organized to serve the general public, but their retailing methods \ndiffer.  The establishments of this subsector reach customers and market merchandise with methods, such as the \nbroadcasting of "infomercials," the broadcasting and publishing of direct-response advertising, the publishing of \npaper and electronic catalogs, door-to-door solicitation, in-home demonstration, selling from portable stalls (street \nvendors, except food), and distribution through vending machines.  Establishments engaged in the direct sale \n(nonstore) of products, such as home heating oil dealers and home delivery newspaper routes are included here. \n   The buying of goods for resale is a characteristic of retail trade establishments that particularly distinguishes them \nfrom establishments in the agriculture, manufacturing, and construction industries.  For example, farms that sell their \nproducts at or from the point of production are not classified in retail, but rather in agriculture.  Similarly, \nestablishments that both manufacture and sell their products to the general public are not classified in retail, but \nrather in manufacturing.  However, establishments that engage in processing activities incidental to retailing are \nclassified in retail.  This includes establishments, such as optical goods stores that do in-store grinding of lenses, and \nmeat and seafood markets. \n   Wholesalers also engage in the buying of goods for resale, but they are not usually organized to serve the general \npublic.  They typically operate from a warehouse or office and neither the design nor the location of these premises \nis intended to solicit a high volume of walk-in traffic.  Wholesalers supply institutional, industrial, wholesale, and \nretail clients; their operations are, therefore, generally organized to purchase, sell, and deliver merchandise in larger \nquantities.  However, dealers of durable nonconsumer goods, such as farm machinery and heavy-duty trucks, are \nincluded in wholesale trade even if they often sell these products in single units. \n\n\x0c \n441  Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers  \n \n   Industries in the Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers subsector retail motor vehicles and parts from fixed point-of-sale \nlocations.  Establishments in this subsector typically operate from a showroom and/or an open lot where the vehicles \nare on display.  The display of vehicles and the related parts require little by way of display equipment.  The \npersonnel generally include both the sales and sales support staff familiar with the requirements for registering and \nfinancing a vehicle as well as a staff of parts experts and mechanics trained to provide repair and maintenance \nservices for the vehicles.  Specific industries have been included in this subsector to identify the type of vehicle \nbeing retailed. \n   Sales of capital or durable nonconsumer goods, such as medium- and heavy-duty trucks, are always included in \nwholesale trade.

Establishments in these industries use transportation equipment or transportation related facilities as \na productive asset.  The type of equipment depends on the mode of transportation.  The modes of transportation are \nair, rail, water, road, and pipeline. \n   The Transportation and Warehousing sector distinguishes three basic types of activities: subsectors for each mode \nof transportation, a subsector for warehousing and storage, and a subsector for establishments providing support \nactivities for transportation.  In addition, there are subsectors for establishments that provide passenger \ntransportation for scenic and sightseeing purposes, postal services, and courier services. \n   A separate subsector for support activities is established in the sector because, first, support activities for \ntransportation are inherently multimodal, such as freight transportation arrangement, or have multimodal aspects.  \nSecondly, there are production process similarities among the support activity industries. \n   One of the support activities identified in the support activity subsector is the routine repair and maintenance of \ntransportation equipment (e.g., aircraft at an airport, railroad rolling stock at a railroad terminal, or ships at a harbor \nor port facility).  Such establishments do not perform complete overhauling or rebuilding of transportation \nequipment (i.e., periodic restoration of transportation equipment to original design specifications) or transportation \nequipment conversion (i.e., major modification to systems).  An establishment that primarily performs factory (or \nshipyard) overhauls, rebuilding, or conversions of aircraft, railroad rolling stock, or a ship is classified in Subsector \n336, Transportation Equipment Manufacturing according to the type of equipment. \n   Many of the establishments in this sector often operate on networks, with physical facilities, labor forces, and \nequipment spread over an extensive geographic area. \n   Warehousing establishments in this sector are distinguished from merchant wholesaling in that the warehouse \nestablishments do not sell the goods. \n   Excluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in providing travel agent services that support \ntransportation and other establishments, such as hotels, businesses, and government agencies.  These establishments \nare classified in Sector 56, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services.  Also, \nestablishments primarily engaged in providing rental and leasing of transportation equipment without operator are \nclassified in Subsector 532, Rental and Leasing Services. \n \n481 \n \n   Industries in the Air Transportation subsector provide air transportation of passengers and/or cargo using aircraft, \nsuch as airplanes and helicopters.  The subsector distinguishes scheduled from nonscheduled air transportation.  \nScheduled air carriers fly regular routes on regular schedules and operate even if flights are only partially loaded.  \nNonscheduled carriers often operate during nonpeak time slots at busy airports.  These establishments have more \nflexibility with respect to choice of airport, hours of operation, load factors, and similar operational characteristics.  \nNonscheduled carriers provide chartered air transportation of passengers, cargo, or specialty flying services.  \nSpecialty flying services establishments use general-purpose aircraft to provide a variety of specialized flying \nservices.  \n   Scenic and sightseeing air transportation and air courier services are not included in this subsector but are included \nin Subsector 487, Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation and in Subsector 492, Couriers and Messengers.  Although \nthese activities may use aircraft, they are different from the activities included in air transportation.  Air sightseeing \ndoes not usually involve place-to-place transportation; the passenger\'s flight (e.g., balloon ride, aerial sightseeing) \ntypically starts and ends at the same location.  Courier services (individual package or cargo delivery) include more \nthan air transportation; road transportation is usually required to deliver the cargo to the intended recipient. \n \n4811 \n \n48111  Scheduled Air TransportationT \n \n\nScheduled Air TransportationT \n\nAir TransportationT \n\n\x0c   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing air transportation of passengers and/or \ncargo over regular routes and on regular schedules.  Establishments in this industry operate flights even if partially \nloaded.

The subsector is subdivided into general freight trucking and specialized \nfreight trucking.  This distinction reflects differences in equipment used, type of load carried, scheduling, terminal, \nand other networking services.  General freight transportation establishments handle a wide variety of general \ncommodities, generally palletized, and transported in a container or van trailer.  Specialized freight transportation is \nthe transportation of cargo that, because of size, weight, shape, or other inherent characteristics require specialized \nequipment for transportation. \n   Each of these industry groups is further subdivided based on distance traveled.  Local trucking establishments \nprimarily carry goods within a single metropolitan area and its adjacent nonurban areas.  Long distance trucking \nestablishments carry goods between metropolitan areas. \n   The Specialized Freight Trucking industry group includes a separate industry for Used Household and Office \nGoods Moving. The household and office goods movers are separated because of the substantial network of \nestablishments that has developed to deal with local and long-distance moving and the associated storage.  In this \narea, the same establishment provides both local and long-distance services, while other specialized freight \nestablishments generally limit their services to either local or long-distance hauling. \n \n4841  General Freight TruckingT \n \n   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing general freight trucking.

The Information sector groups three types of \nestablishments: (1) those engaged in producing and distributing information and cultural products; (2) those that \nprovide the means to transmit or distribute these products as well as data or communications; and (3) those that \nprocess data.  Cultural products are those that directly express attitudes, opinions, ideas, values, and artistic \ncreativity; provide entertainment; or offer information and analysis concerning the past and present.  Included in this \ndefinition are popular, mass-produced products as well as cultural products that normally have a more limited \naudience, such as poetry books, literary magazines, or classical records. \n   The unique characteristics of information and cultural products, and of the processes involved in their production \nand distribution, distinguish the Information sector from the goods-producing and service-producing sectors.  Some \nof these characteristics are: \n \n1. Unlike traditional goods, an \'\'information or cultural product,\'\' such as a newspaper on-line or television program, \ndoes not necessarily have tangible qualities, nor is it necessarily associated with a particular form. A movie can be \nshown at a movie theater, on a television broadcast, through video-on-demand or rented at a local video store. A \nsound recording can be aired on radio, embedded in multimedia products, or sold at a record store. \n \n2. Unlike traditional services, the delivery of these products does not require direct contact between the supplier and \nthe consumer. \n \n3. The value of these products to the consumer lies in their informational, educational, cultural, or entertainment \ncontent, not in the format in which they are distributed.  Most of these products are protected from unlawful \nreproduction by copyright laws.  \n \n4. The intangible property aspect of information and cultural products makes the processes involved in their \nproduction and distribution very different from goods and services.  Only those possessing the rights to these works \nare authorized to reproduce, alter, improve, and distribute them.  Acquiring and using these rights often involves \nsignificant costs.  In addition, technology is revolutionizing the distribution of these products.  It is possible to \ndistribute them in a physical form, via broadcast, or on-line. \n \n5. Distributors of information and cultural products can easily add value to the products they distribute.  For \ninstance, broadcasters add advertising not contained in the original product.  This capacity means that unlike \ntraditional distributors, they derive revenue not from sale of the distributed product to the final consumer, but from \nthose who pay for the privilege of adding information to the original product.  Similarly, a directory and mailing list \npublisher can acquire the rights to thousands of previously published newspaper and periodical articles and add new \nvalue by providing search and software and organizing the information in a way that facilitates research and \nretrieval.  These products often command a much higher price than the original information. \n \n\n\x0cPublishing Industries (except Internet)T \n\n  The distribution modes for information commodities may either eliminate the necessity for traditional manufacture, \nor reverse the conventional order of manufacture-distribute:  A newspaper distributed on-line, for example, can be \nprinted locally or by the final consumer.  Similarly, it is anticipated that packaged software, which today is mainly \nbought through the traditional retail channels, will soon be available mainly on-line.  The NAICS Information sector \nis designed to make such economic changes transparent as they occur, or to facilitate designing surveys that will \nmonitor the new phenomena and provide data to analyze the changes. \n   Many of the industries in the NAICS Information sector are engaged in producing products protected by copyright \nlaw, or in distributing them (other than distribution by traditional wholesale and retail methods).  Examples are \ntraditional publishing industries, software and directory and mailing list publishing industries, and film and sound \nindustries.  Broadcasting and telecommunications industries and information providers and processors are also \nincluded in the Information sector, because their technologies are so closely linked to other industries in the \nInformation sector. \n \n511 \n \n   Industries in the Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector group establishments engaged in the publishing \nof newspapers, magazines, other periodicals, and books, as well as directory and mailing list and software \npublishing.  In general, these establishments, which are known as publishers, issue copies of works for which they \nusually possess copyright.  Works may be in one or more formats including traditional print form, CD-ROM, or \nproprietary electronic networks.  Publishers may publish works originally created by others for which they have \nobtained the rights and/or works that they have created in-house.  Software publishing is included here because the \nactivity, creation of a copyrighted product and bringing it to market, is equivalent to the creation process for other \ntypes of intellectual products. \n   In NAICS, publishing--the reporting, writing, editing, and other processes that are required to create an edition of \na newspaper--is treated as a major economic activity in its own right, rather than as a subsidiary activity to a \nmanufacturing activity, printing.  Thus, publishing is classified in the Information sector; whereas, printing remains \nin the NAICS Manufacturing sector.  In part, the NAICS classification reflects the fact that publishing increasingly \ntakes place in establishments that are physically separate from the associated printing establishments.  More \ncrucially, the NAICS classification of book and newspaper publishing is intended to portray their roles in a modern \neconomy, in which they do not resemble manufacturing activities. \n   Music publishers are not included in the Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector, but are included in the \nMotion Picture and Sound Recording Industries subsector.  Reproduction of prepackaged software is treated in \nNAICS as a manufacturing activity; on-line distribution of software products is in the Information sector, and \ncustom design of software to client specifications is included in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services \nsector.  These distinctions arise because of the different ways that software is created, reproduced, and distributed. \n   The Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector does not include establishments that publish exclusively on \nthe Internet.  Establishments publishing exclusively on the Internet are included in Subsector 519, Other Information \nService.  The Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector also excludes products, such as manifold business \nforms.  Information is not the essential component of these items.  Establishments producing these items are \nincluded in Subsector 323, Printing and Related Support Activities. \n \n5111  Newspaper, Periodical, Book, and Directory PublishersT \n \n   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in publishing newspapers, magazines, other \nperiodicals, books, directories and mailing lists, and other works, such as calendars, greeting cards, and maps.  \nThese works are characterized by the intellectual creativity required in their development and are usually protected \nby copyright.  Publishers distribute or arrange for the distribution of these works. \n   Publishing establishments may create the works in-house, contract for, purchase, or compile works that were \noriginally created by others.  These works may be published in one or more formats, such as print and/or electronic \nform, including proprietary electronic networks.  Establishments in this industry may print, reproduce, or offer direct \naccess to the works themselves or may arrange with others to carry out such functions. \n   Establishments that both print and publish may fill excess capacity with commercial or job printing.  However, the \npublishing activity is still considered to be the primary activity of these establishments. \n \n51111  Newspaper PublishersT \n\nSee industry description for 511110 below. \n\n\x0c \n511110  Newspaper Publishers  \n \n   This industry comprises establishments known as newspaper publishers.

While producers and distributors of motion \npictures and sound recordings issue works for sale as traditional publishers do, the processes are sufficiently \ndifferent to warrant placing establishments engaged in these activities in a separate subsector.  Production is \ntypically a complex process that involves several distinct types of establishments that are engaged in activities, such \nas contracting with performers, creating the film or sound content, and providing technical postproduction services.  \nFilm distribution is often to exhibitors, such as theaters and broadcasters, rather than through the wholesale and \nretail distribution chain.  When the product is in a mass-produced form, NAICS treats production and distribution as \nthe major economic activity as it does in the Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector, rather than as a \nsubsidiary activity to the manufacture of such products. \n   This subsector does not include establishments primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of videocassettes \nand sound recordings, such as compact discs and audio tapes; these establishments are included in the Wholesale \n\n\x0cTrade sector.

Three principal types of activities are identified: \n \n   1.  Raising funds by taking deposits and/or issuing securities and, in the process, incurring liabilities.  \nEstablishments engaged in this activity use raised funds to acquire financial assets by making loans and/or \npurchasing securities.  Putting themselves at risk, they channel funds from lenders to borrowers and transform or \nrepackage the funds with respect to maturity, scale, and risk.  This activity is known as financial intermediation. \n \n   2.  Pooling of risk by underwriting insurance and annuities.  Establishments engaged in this activity collect fees, \ninsurance premiums, or annuity considerations; build up reserves; invest those reserves; and make contractual \npayments.  Fees are based on the expected incidence of the insured risk and the expected return on investment. \n \n   3.  Providing specialized services facilitating or supporting financial intermediation, insurance, and employee \nbenefit programs. \n \n   In addition, monetary authorities charged with monetary control are included in this sector. \n   The subsectors, industry groups, and industries within the NAICS Finance and Insurance sector are defined on the \nbasis of their unique production processes.  As with all industries, the production processes are distinguished by \ntheir use of specialized human resources and specialized physical capital.  In addition, the way in which these \nestablishments acquire and allocate financial capital, their source of funds, and the use of those funds provides a \nthird basis for distinguishing characteristics of the production process.  For instance, the production process in \nraising funds through deposit-taking is different from the process of raising funds in bond or money markets.  The \nprocess of making loans to individuals also requires different production processes than does the creation of \ninvestment pools or the underwriting of securities. \n   Most of the Finance and Insurance subsectors contain one or more industry groups of (1) intermediaries with \nsimilar patterns of raising and using funds and (2) establishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are \notherwise related to, that type of financial or insurance intermediation.  Industries within this sector are defined in \nterms of activities for which a production process can be specified, and many of these activities are not exclusive to \na particular type of financial institution.  To deal with the varied activities taking place within existing financial \ninstitutions, the approach is to split these institutions into components performing specialized services.  This requires \ndefining the units engaged in providing those services and developing procedures that allow for their delineation.  \nThese units are the equivalents for finance and insurance of the establishments defined for other industries. \n   The output of many financial services, as well as the inputs and the processes by which they are combined, cannot \nbe observed at a single location and can only be defined at a higher level of the organizational structure of the \nenterprise.  Additionally, a number of independent activities that represent separate and distinct production \nprocesses may take place at a single location belonging to a multilocation financial firm.  Activities are more likely \nto be homogeneous with respect to production characteristics than are locations, at least in financial services.  The \nclassification defines activities broadly enough that it can be used both by those classifying by location and by those \nemploying a more top-down approach to the delineation of the establishment. \n   Establishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are otherwise related to, the various types of intermediation \nhave been included in individual subsectors, rather than in a separate subsector dedicated to services alone because \nthese services are performed by intermediaries, as well as by specialist establishments, the extent to which the \nactivity of the intermediaries can be separately identified is not clear. \n   The Finance and Insurance sector has been defined to encompass establishments primarily engaged in financial \ntransactions; that is, transactions involving the creation, liquidation, change in ownership of financial assets; or in \nfacilitating financial transactions.  Financial industries are extensive users of electronic means for facilitating the \nverification of financial balances, authorizing transactions, transferring funds to and from transactors\' accounts, \nnotifying banks (or credit card issuers) of the individual transactions, and providing daily summaries.  Since these \ntransaction processing activities are integral to the production of finance and insurance services, establishments that \n\n\x0cprincipally provide a financial transaction processing service are classified to this sector, rather than to the data \nprocessing industry in the Information sector. \n   Legal entities that hold portfolios of assets on behalf of others are significant and data on them are required for a \nvariety of purposes.  Thus for NAICS, these funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles are the fifth subsector of the \nFinance and Insurance sector.  These entities earn interest, dividends, and other property income, but have little or \nno employment and no revenue from the sale of services.  Separate establishments and employees devoted to the \nmanagement of funds are classified in Industry Group 5239, Other Financial Investment Activities. \n \n521  Monetary Authorities-Central BankT \n \n   The Monetary Authorities-Central Bank subsector groups establishments that engage in performing central \nbanking functions, such as issuing currency, managing the Nation\'s money supply and international reserves, \nholding deposits that represent the reserves of other banks and other central banks, and acting as a fiscal agent for \nthe central government. \n \n5211  Monetary Authorities-Central BankT \n \n52111  Monetary Authorities-Central BankT \n\nSee industry description for 521110 below \n\nCredit Intermediation and Related ActivitiesT \n\n \n521110  Monetary Authorities-Central Bank \n \n   This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in performing central banking functions, such as issuing \ncurrency, managing the Nation\'s money supply and international reserves, holding deposits that represent the \nreserves of other banks and other central banks, and acting as a fiscal agent for the central government. \n \nCross-References. \n \n   Establishments of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System are classified in Industry 921130, Public \nFinance Activities. \n \n522 \n \n   Industries in the Credit Intermediation and Related Activities subsector group establishments that (1) lend funds \nraised from depositors; (2) lend funds raised from credit market borrowing; or (3) facilitate the lending of funds or \nissuance of credit by engaging in such activities as mortgage and loan brokerage, clearinghouse and reserve services, \nand check cashing services. \n \n5221  Depository Credit Intermediation  \n \n   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in accepting deposits (or share deposits) and in \nlending funds from these deposits.

The first type typically operates from a retail-like or store-front facility and maintains inventories of \ngoods that are rented for short periods of time.  The latter type typically does not operate from retail-like locations or \nmaintain inventories, and offers longer term leases.  These establishments work directly with clients to enable them \n\n\x0cto acquire the use of equipment on a lease basis, or they work with equipment vendors or dealers to support the \nmarketing of equipment to their customers under lease arrangements.  Equipment lessors generally structure lease \ncontracts to meet the specialized needs of their clients and use their remarketing expertise to find other users for \npreviously leased equipment.  Establishments that provide operating and capital (i.e., finance) leases are included in \nthis subsector. \n   Establishments primarily engaged in leasing in combination with providing loans are classified in Sector 52, \nFinance and Insurance.  Establishments primarily engaged in leasing real property are classified in Subsector 531, \nReal Estate.  Those establishments primarily engaged in renting or leasing equipment with operators are classified in \nvarious subsectors of NAICS depending on the nature of the services provided (e.g., Transportation, Construction, \nAgriculture).  These activities are excluded from this subsector since the client is paying for the expertise and \nknowledge of the equipment operator, in addition to the rental of the equipment.  In many cases, such as the rental of \nheavy construction equipment, the operator is essential to operate the equipment.  Likewise, since the provision of \ncrop harvesting services includes both the equipment and operator, it is included in the agriculture subsector.  The \nrental or leasing of copyrighted works is classified in Sector 51, Information, and the rental or leasing of assets, such \nas patents, trademarks, and/or licensing agreements is classified in Subsector 533, Lessors of Nonfinancial \nIntangible Assets (except Copyrighted Works). \n \n5321  Automotive Equipment Rental and LeasingT \n \n   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in renting or leasing the following types of \nvehicles:  passenger cars and trucks without drivers, and utility trailers.  These establishments generally operate \nfrom a retail-like facility.

These activities require a high degree of expertise and \ntraining.  The establishments in this sector specialize according to expertise and provide these services to clients in a \nvariety of industries and, in some cases, to households.  Activities performed include: legal advice and \nrepresentation; accounting, bookkeeping, and payroll services; architectural, engineering, and specialized design \nservices; computer services; consulting services; research services; advertising services; photographic services; \ntranslation and interpretation services; veterinary services; and other professional, scientific, and technical services. \n   This sector excludes establishments primarily engaged in providing a range of day-to-day office administrative \nservices, such as financial planning, billing and recordkeeping, personnel, and physical distribution and logistics.  \nThese establishments are classified in Sector 56, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and \nRemediation Services. \n \n541 \n \n   Industries in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services subsector group establishments engaged in \nprocesses where human capital is the major input.

The individual industries of this subsector are defined on the basis of the particular expertise and \ntraining of the services provider. \n   The distinguishing feature of the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services subsector is the fact that most of \nthe industries grouped in it have production processes that are almost wholly dependent on worker skills.  In most of \nthese industries, equipment and materials are not of major importance, unlike health care, for example, where "high \ntech" machines and materials are important collaborating inputs to labor skills in the production of health care.  \nThus, the establishments classified in this subsector sell expertise.

Activities performed include: office administration, \nhiring and placing of personnel, document preparation and similar clerical services, solicitation, collection, security \nand surveillance services, cleaning, and waste disposal services. \n   The administrative and management activities performed by establishments in this sector are typically on a \ncontract or fee basis.

The processes employed in this sector (e.g., general \nmanagement, personnel administration, clerical activities, cleaning activities) are often integral parts of the activities \nof establishments found in all sectors of the economy.  The establishments classified in this subsector have \nspecialization in one or more of these activities and can, therefore, provide services to clients in a variety of \nindustries and, in some cases, to households.  The individual industries of this subsector are defined on the basis of \nthe particular process that they are engaged in and the particular services they provide. \n   Many of the activities performed in this subsector are ongoing routine support functions that all businesses and \norganizations must do and that they have traditionally done for themselves.  Recent trends, however, are to contract \nor purchase such services from businesses that specialize in such activities and can, therefore, provide the services \nmore efficiently. \n   The industries in this subsector cannot be viewed as strictly "support." The Travel Arrangement and Reservation \nServices industry group includes travel agents, tour operators, and providers of other travel arrangement services, \nsuch as hotel and restaurant reservations and arranging the purchase of tickets, serving many types of clients, \nincluding individual consumers.  This group was placed in this subsector because the services are often of the \n"support" nature (e.g., travel arrangement) and businesses and other organizations are increasingly the ones \npurchasing such services. \n   The administrative and management activities performed by establishments in this sector are typically on a \ncontract or fee basis.

Excluded from this sector are: (1) establishments that provide both accommodations and recreational \nfacilities, such as hunting and fishing camps and resort and casino hotels are classified in Subsector 721, \nAccommodation; (2) restaurants and night clubs that provide live entertainment in addition to the sale of food and \nbeverages are classified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places; (3) motion picture theaters, libraries \nand archives, and publishers of newspapers, magazines, books, periodicals, and computer software are classified in \nSector 51, Information; and (4) establishments using transportation equipment to provide recreational and \nentertainment services, such as those operating sightseeing buses, dinner cruises, or helicopter rides, are classified in \nSubsector 487, Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation. \n \n711 \n \n   Industries in the Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector group establishments that \nproduce or organize and promote live presentations involving the performances of actors and actresses, singers, \ndancers, musical groups and artists, athletes, and other entertainers, including independent (i.e., freelance) \nentertainers and the establishments that manage their careers.  The classification recognizes four basic processes: (1) \nproducing (i.e., presenting) events; (2) organizing, managing, and/or promoting events; (3) managing and \nrepresenting entertainers; and (4) providing the artistic, creative and technical skills necessary to the production of \nthese live events.  Also, this subsector contains four industries for performing arts companies.  Each is defined on \nthe basis of the particular skills of the entertainers involved in the presentations. \n   The industry structure for this subsector makes a clear distinction between performing arts companies and \nperforming artists (i.e., independent or freelance).  Although not unique to arts and entertainment, freelancing is a \nparticularly important phenomenon in this Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector.  \nDistinguishing this activity from the production activity is a meaningful process differentiation.  This approach, \nhowever, is difficult to implement in the case of musical groups (i.e., companies) and artists, especially pop groups.  \nThese establishments tend to be more loosely organized and it can be difficult to distinguish companies from \nfreelancers.  For this reason, NAICS includes one industry that covers both musical groups and musical artists. \n   This subsector contains two industries for Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar \nEvents, one for those that operate facilities and another for those that do not.  This is because there are significant \ndifferences in cost structures between those promoters that manage and provide the staff to operate facilities and \nthose that do not.  In addition to promoters without facilities, other industries in this subsector include \nestablishments that may operate without permanent facilities.  These types of establishments include: performing \narts companies; musical groups and artists; spectator sports; and independent (i.e., freelance) artists, writers, and \nperformers. \n   Excluded from this subsector are nightclubs.  Some nightclubs promote live entertainment on a regular basis and it \ncan be argued that they could be classified in Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and \nSimilar Events.  However, since most of these establishments function as any other drinking place when they do not \npromote entertainment and because most of their revenue is derived from sale of food and beverages, they are \nclassified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places. \n \n7111 \n \n   This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in producing live presentations involving the \nperformances of actors and actresses, singers, dancers, musical groups and artists, and other performing artists. \n \n\nPerforming Arts CompaniesT \n\n\x0c71111  Theater Companies and Dinner TheatersT \n\nSee industry description for 711110 below. \n\n \n711110  Theater Companies and Dinner Theaters  \n \n   This industry comprises (1) companies, groups, or theaters primarily engaged in producing the following live \ntheatrical presentations: musicals; operas; plays; and comedy, improvisational, mime, and puppet shows and (2) \nestablishments, commonly known as dinner theaters, engaged in producing live theatrical productions and in \nproviding food and beverages for consumption on the premises.

Establishments in this sector are primarily \nengaged in activities such as equipment and machinery repairing, promoting or administering religious activities, \ngrantmaking, advocacy, and providing drycleaning and laundry services, personal care services, death care services, \npet care services, photofinishing services, temporary parking services, and dating services. \n   Private households that engage in employing workers on or about the premises in activities primarily concerned \nwith the operation of the household are included in this sector. \n   Excluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in retailing new equipment and also performing \nrepairs and general maintenance on equipment.  These establishments are classified in Sector 44-45, Retail Trade. \n \n811 \n \n   Industries in the Repair and Maintenance subsector restore machinery, equipment, and other products to working \norder.  These establishments also typically provide general or routine maintenance (i.e., servicing) on such products \nto ensure they work efficiently and to prevent breakdown and unnecessary repairs. \n   The NAICS structure for this subsector brings together most types of repair and maintenance establishments and \ncategorizes them based on production processes (i.e., on the type of repair and maintenance activity performed, and \nthe necessary skills, expertise, and processes that are found in different repair and maintenance establishments).  \nThis NAICS classification does not delineate between repair services provided to businesses versus those that serve \nhouseholds.  Although some industries primarily serve either businesses or households, separation by class of \ncustomer is limited by the fact that many establishments serve both.  Establishments repairing computers and \nconsumer electronics products are two examples of such overlap. \n   The Repair and Maintenance subsector does not include all establishments that do repair and maintenance.  For \nexample, a substantial amount of repair is done by establishments that also manufacture machinery, equipment, and \nother goods.  These establishments are included in the Manufacturing sector in NAICS.  In addition, repair of \ntransportation equipment is often provided by or based at transportation facilities, such as airports and seaports, and \nthese activities are included in the Transportation and Warehousing sector.  A particularly unique situation exists \nwith repair of buildings.  Plumbing, electrical installation and repair, painting and decorating, and other \nconstruction-related establishments are often involved in performing installation or other work on new construction \nas well as providing repair services on existing structures.  While some specialize in repair, it is difficult to \ndistinguish between the two types and all have been included in the Construction sector. \n   Excluded from this subsector are establishments primarily engaged in rebuilding or remanufacturing machinery \nand equipment.  These are classified in Sector 31-33, Manufacturing.  Also excluded are retail establishments that \nprovide after-sale services and repair.  These are classified in Sector 44-45, Retail Trade. \n \n8111  Automotive Repair and MaintenanceT \n \n   This industry group comprises establishments involved in providing repair and maintenance services for \nautomotive vehicles, such as passenger cars, trucks, and vans, and all trailers.

These agencies also set policy, create laws, adjudicate civil and criminal legal \ncases, provide for public safety and for national defense.  In general, government establishments in the Public \nAdministration sector oversee governmental programs and activities that are not performed by private \nestablishments.  Establishments in this sector typically are engaged in the organization and financing of the \nproduction of public goods and services, most of which are provided for free or at prices that are not economically \nsignificant. \n   Government establishments also engage in a wide range of productive activities covering not only public goods \nand services but also individual goods and services similar to those produced in sectors typically identified with \nprivate-sector establishments.  In general, ownership is not a criterion for classification in NAICS.  Therefore, \ngovernment establishments engaged in the production of private-sector-like goods and services should be classified \nin the same industry as private-sector establishments engaged in similar activities. \n   As a practical matter, it is difficult to identify separate establishment detail for many government agencies.  To the \nextent that separate establishment records are available, the administration of governmental programs is classified in \nSector 92, Public Administration, while the operation of that same governmental program is classified elsewhere in \nNAICS based on the activities performed.  For example, the governmental administrative authority for an airport is \nclassified in Industry 92612, Regulation and Administration of Transportation Programs, while operating the airport \nis classified in Industry 48811, Airport Operations.  When separate records for multi-establishment companies are \nnot available to distinguish between the administration of a governmental program and the operation of it, the \nestablishment is classified in Sector 92, Public Administration. \n   Examples of government-provided goods and services that are classified in sectors other than Public \nAdministration include: schools, classified in Sector 61, Educational Services; hospitals, classified in Subsector 622, \nHospitals; establishments operating transportation facilities, classified in Sector 48-49, Transportation and \nWarehousing; the operation of utilities, classified in Sector 22, Utilities; and the Government Printing Office, \nclassified in Subsector 323, Printing and Related Support Activities. \n \n921 \n \n   The Executive, Legislative, and Other General Government Support subsector groups offices of government \nexecutives, legislative bodies, public finance and general government support. \n \n9211 \n \n92111  Executive Offices  \n\nExecutive, Legislative, and Other General Government Support  \n\nExecutive, Legislative, and Other General Government Support  \n\nSee industry description for 921110 below. \n\n \n921110  Executive Offices  \n \n   This industry comprises government establishments serving as offices of chief executives and their advisory \ncommittees and commissions.
